I built an [Infinity Mirror Installation](https://www.makersasylum.com/projects/adidas-installation/) for Adidas’s new product launch in collaboration with Homegrown magazine, and Maker’s Asylum. The product launch event took place at Todi Mill Social in Mathurdas Mill Compound, Lower Parel, Mumbai.
