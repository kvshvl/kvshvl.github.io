Client: [_Thomas Albert Music_](https://www.instagram.com/thomasalbertmusic).

I co-wrote a song with Thomas Albert. [_See making of the song_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycdXPY99Eeg). Listen to [_St. Lucifer on Saavn_](https://www.saavn.com/song/st.-lucifer-pull-me-out-feat.-thomas-albert--rani-viswas/FD1caDEBb2c). [_Watch lyrics video_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T4-8pfGwYE).

**The lyrics.**
“The moon is out,

I wake up to the morning star; 
standing in the mirror.”

“Those greedy eyes,

are calling out my name;

like the crystal bells I hear.”

“Sing a song,

or do the thing;

pull me out of this spell.”

“Step right in,

you are home;

says the gates of hell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out the gates of hell.“

“I hear the wind,

he’s preaching now in my ears;

framing hell in my spine.”

“Behold the truth,

emerges in a different light;

fallen angel in disguise.”

“Call someone,

let me take a pill;

pull me out of this spell.”

“Step right in,

you are home;

says the gates of hell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out the gates of hell.“

“He told me,

I could follow my heart;

and forget all my despair.”

“Let the blood-thirst beast,

invite me in;

right into his lair.”

“Step right in,

you are home;

says the gates of hell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out the gates of hell.“

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out of this spell.”

“Pull, pull, pull me out,

pull me out the gates of hell.“
