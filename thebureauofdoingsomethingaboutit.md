**A Mind That Creates.**


Lose an hour in the morning, and you will spend all day looking for it. — Richard Whately.


This is a journal entry on routines, and behaviours that come from people who are successful in different walks of life. E.g. The 4am club. I am a stern believer that the miniscule things that we do everyday amount to a lot in our life. If you have read James Clerk’s thesis on the Pareto principle, you will find that to the 1% of the world who happen to be winning at life, winning doesn’t happen. Winning is created. Curiously carved, over a long period of time. Waking up at 4am is an easy thing to do. If you differ with me on this point then that’s because it is also easy not to. The early hours of a day can give you the energy to get more done without much stress. Time flies, and at 4am it surely does. Every moment you spend in not doing or following your life’s purpose is a moment spent in undoing it.


Most of the successful people I have met, track time consciously. And they don’t do it by the hour. They do it by the minute. Some of them, do it by the seconds. Once you get here, your amount of focus will determine if you will track time by the seconds. Peak performance is not an aim, it is a way of life. If you can get yourself to a happy, energetic mood before the hustle bustle of the world around your begins, then you have half won the day. Preparation is often the only differentiator between what gets done easy, and what gets done hardly. Consistency on the other hand will drive you into a spiral. Forward going, or backward moving spiral depends on the habits that you cultivate.


This cultivation is a daily activity, so here’s a thing to do. Wake up at 4am, and read. Read whatever you think will spur your interest, and read something positive. Let positivity spur your interest. This is the beginning of a spiral. Most of my guests spend their mornings in utter silence. They be in the moment, and they design the moment as a stepping stone for all the moments that follow in the day. Some people run at 5am. Running/ any kind of exercise as Casey Neistat often says, helps you cover for lesser sleep. It means that if you sleep for 6 hours a day, and run for 2 hours in the morning.


Your mind, and body will feel, and be healthier than sleeping for 8 hours, without any exercise. Usually, no mind bursts into unproductive habits the moment it wakes up. You need to give it direction. You can only make a few good decisions in a day. And the surety of a decision being good lies on how early in the day do you make a decision. Capitalize on the silence that you get in the morning. Not by making coffee though. Not by trudging through whatever direction your mind picks. But by being wakeful. By consciously knowing where you want to head, and what do you want to achieve.


This is what my guests spend an hour thinking in the morning. They don’t take down notes. They de-cide. Our brain is a database. It has stored memory, years of daily experiences which form the basis of your instinct. When you ask it a question, the first answer that you will get, is the right answer. The answer that your mind tells you, not the answer you speak out. Things will slowly accumulate to give you an edge, e.g. It took me some many bullet points to write a paragraph without having to strive for it. The most common mistake we do, is to not declutter. When you know how you spend your time, you have the power to question every action you take.


And by actions I mean things like looking left or glancing right. These small involuntary actions can shape a lot of your decisions. Because your senses will feed on the surplus of information that is now so easily available in this age. Your job is to consciously say “NO!”. It might take you days before you start catching yourself doing this. It might take you another few weeks to start saying “NO!” with ease. So a faster way of doing this is by beginning the day with self scrutiny. Analyzing your usual. An hour spent knowing where to catch yourself will help you catch yourself doing dumb shit better. You now have an exact summary of where your time goes.


If you relentlessly de-clutter, and spend your time doing only those things that you do in a day simultaneously, you will find yourself doing your usual at unusual hours. This bit itself is curiosity inspiring. Being curious is essential at being creative. And if you do your work beforehand, you will end up with mass, and I mean MASS amounts of time in the same day, without a clue of what more can you do. This is like writing down a bucket list with a 100 things on it. Most people have to really start thinking hard about their dreams once they fill in about 25–50 things. You will have to really put your mind to work in figuring out the not so dumb to do things for the rest of your day. That my friends, is a dilemma worth being in. If you are a creative, let me rephrase that: Life is a creative establishment. And creativity is the only positive way to live.


Nothing in life is easy. You can be anyone you want. You could be anyone now. But you will not be joyful if you don’t innovate your way through life. You should essentially think of the solutions to your most daunting problems/challenges at 6AM, or to be more exact, in the shower after your run. And read closely. Think of the solutions/challenges, not of your daunting problems. Make it a habit to take an hour long shower. This does not mean that you waste water by keeping your taps running. It solely means leaving your phone outside the bath, and spending an hour thinking in that closed room, undisturbed.


Silence, and solitude is an antidote to stress. See, the human mind zones out if it has to go through tremendous amount of mental stress, or physical pain. It zones out not as a cowardly response, but as a mere attempt to research for relief. It is searching for silence, and solitude so that it can be less distracted when it is working on finding the solutions to the objects of stress. Change of jobs is also a means of taking a break. I don’t mean your day-job. I mean doing something else at hand for sometime. It’s like you can either dribble yourself tired across the football pitch, and try to score a goal, or better, you can pass the ball from player to player, and be fresh enough to try scoring the goal again. You can choose to edit your bath short, and zone out while you make yourself some breakfast. But thinking while your eating can set in a habit of daydreaming.


Rejuvenating your body without paying close attention to the activity is not that healthy. Let’s stick to longer time in the showers for starters. Once you are ready to go-to work or wherever without a roof on yourself, try to find your horizon. Not mentally, but physically. Look at the further point of the street. I bet that you have not taken this gaze intently before. You will see things that you did not notice before. It can be a busy street, or it can be a plant on a field. But you will see new things. This is helpful because here’s what funny.


Your life is the exact replica of the things you notice, the things you do, and the behaviours you follow — your habits. One of my Hungarian friends has a knack for cleanliness, a kind of an OCD. He told me that it was an Hungarian thing. But I don’t think it’s something that is specific to a particular race of people. What he told me was this. There is a reason why human beings behave in a certain fashion to others based on a perceived effect of the person they are interacting with. We are all blinking (refer Malcolm Gladwell) at each other without a moment’s restraint. We are looking for the things we do. We are searching for clues. We are sizing people up.


Largely because “How you do anything is how you do everything.” This is the same reason why we humans have things like dinner dates, and luncheon meetings. It is a neat way of figuring someone out subconsciously by watching them eat. No wait, it’s watching them manage their plate rather. The way you organize yourself at the table can help people gauge your habits or reactions to life. The way you manage your food, or say resources. The way you treat table manners, or rules. What you do with the leftovers, if you have any. There are a lot of clues if you look closely. It is essentially the most believable metric to the effect of how our behaviors connect.


Our habits shape us. We really have a few habits. Only different scenarios, and variations of it. The most common habit that is widely evident in people is neglect. It is also one of the starting, and fueling habits of all the downward spirals in the history of mankind. Looking at the horizon physically, will help you look at your mental horizon. Your mind stretches in a direct proportion to the depth of your gaze. This is the effect of space on our minds. Space can affect our minds, emotions, thoughts, and hence hold an influence over the behaviors that we exhibit. After seeing people huddled together in a tiny space under the pretext of an event or a gathering, in spaces designed to accommodate such affairs, I have gathered an interest in better understanding people, and the effects that spaces /emotions play in their behaviors.


**A Rule Of Thumb.**


Not the exact nature of woodworking but the idea of how things can be built. Bit by bit, block by block, or layer by layer. This layering is what everything around us is made of. From emotions to nature, even time. Relativity, or a better word to use would be relational-ity, is the key of how human understanding is formed. The ability to understand phenomena by adding known context is essential. Although this approach can make it harder for us to accept some things because they don’t fit in our history of experiences. This bit can explain natural or supernatural occurrences. This bit can also explain why everyone ran 4-minute miles within a week of the first guy who ran it. The thing to take away here is that the most common mistake we do is to think that people think like we do.


Thought is an experiential concept. So is emotion. We are all living in a dream world. Our dependence on technology will devour all the humanness that is within us. Changing our sector of employment will be a need in the coming future. The only thing that is at the root of all our problems these days as a civilization is technology. The slot machine dopamine loops that we have shaped our lives around are something we will have to struggle to break out of eventually. Even though Amazon, and other multinational companies are making lives easier by providing for most of the services that were relevant in the past decade. This move is going to cost humanity. I believe Jeff Bezos may have good intentions but the overall effect of his actions are going to be the end all for most of us.


Netflix may provide you entertainment, and bring out the best of the entertainment world. But there is a catch. When I was a kid, I would literally have a season for theaters. I did not fancy them back then. Now I realize that the amount of social interaction that comes from being around real people, and interacting with other people on a daily basis does shape the overall personality that we hold. It shapes the risk we take, and also priorities our own comfort over what’s right. There is a storm coming. A storm of education debt that has accumulated in the United States Of America. It is something that we have not prepared for. If you have money to get through these tough times, you are safe.


If you have the ability to restrain yourself from spending your time, the most valuable resource, on dumb shit then you might not really need the amount of money the rich will spend in this time of crisis. I find it hard to accept the notion that most of us are oblivious to the obvious dangers of the current state of our civilization. I believe most of us are being lazy to chase less of social media, and more of life. There is so much more that we are missing out on by putting our heads down into our phones. There is so much more in libraries, theaters, and people that we haven’t tapped yet. Artificial intelligence may be claimed to be the best thing. But it comes with yet another catch. It comes with vast pockets of time that we haven’t thought of how to use. AI comes with idleness. And an idle mind is the devil’s workshop.


The vast source of information that is available to us is lethal.


- *An overdose of information is lethal.*


It will drive us into inactivity, indecisiveness, and sheer disconcert for the others around us. It brings lethargy. And this is the bubble that will burst with a lot of lives on stake. So what can be a the solution to this? Having a practical priority. Finding out what won’t change in the next decade for vocation. Gratitude towards everyone, and everything. Choosing others before you, collectively. Spending time together with people, not technology.


Our thumbs are probably a good indicator of where we are heading in our lives. Not the index finger that points out directions to others. Yes that’s correct. The index finger is for others. The thumb is for us. The things you hold, the things you make, and the things you tap on your screens have only one thing in common for all of us. The thumb. You may find the tone of this post hilarious, but then this is the only true indicator that’s right under our noses, that’s natural, from birth, and that’s devoid of any other need of technology. So if you are into profound thinking for making better decisions, asking better questions, and designing your own life then, start with your thumb. Your map will never be more accurate.


Delete the things you can’t contribute to, and delete the things that don’t contribute to you. It can be the things you hoard, your wardrobe, your friendships, and enmities. Your time is valuable. After the age of 18, with the ongoing rate of life expectancy in most countries, you will see only about 25000 sunrises. I hope this gives you a new perspective. Be present. Be present in the present. A friend told me that you cannot be in the future or the past. If you spend your mind being attached to the past, not only shall you miss out on what’s happening right now, but also be delusional. If only you can stay in the present, and let the universe explore itself through your creative senses.


It takes a certain amount of physical exercising like running to feel ready, and open minded to take in these expressions. Casey Neistat runs in NYC. Kushal Samant runs in Bangalore. No one stares at Casey, but they do at Kushal because Bangalore is more of a close knit community. This might explain why personal space is a thing for the Americans. This explains why Viren Brahmbhatt snapped, “What do you care?” when asked when his birthday was. It might come of as rude to some of us, but he was in the right. Behaviours are dominated by the place we belong to. Behaviours are not a cultural thing. Culture itself is a vague idea.


The people you keep are a bigger influence on your creativity than your past, and culture. The point to learn here is that we should focus on creating, and not creativity. Creativity comes. The way to do is to begin. You might never know what you will create.


But if you take the pen, and start scribbling, you will get past the first few lines of utter lack of clarity combined with wholesome words that have no direction to the conversations. But if you just begin, everything that’s messed up will start to fall into place. In ways that will make the mess seem like a petty folly.


**Podcast.**


I tried walking, and recording a podcast on @[anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/buroparcel) today. I did this instead of my daily 4AM hour reading. The idea seems interesting, but there are hurdles, and glitches. The biggest hurdle would probably be people in vehicles asking for directions. They break your flow of thought.


It would I am guessing take practice to find relevant pointers to create impromptu content if you are stalled mid-way. To add to that, the app has amazing, and sensitive sound reception which does not differentiate between human voice, and surrounding sounds. The glitches would be the 20 min segment that I recorded as a part to my hour long episode is stuck at “uploading to library”. Although the prelude got saved just fine. Maybe I should try doing 5 min segments.


The other glitch was that the app does not record, or store segments if you think of reading written notes from another app such as Google Keep. The recording disappears, and you land up on Anchor’s home screen. I lost about 15 min of content here. The app has a beautiful gallery of SFX, sounds, and music to use as Interlude, or background scores to your recordings. Almost to extent where you can create pure music mixes in anchor. It’s fun how this helps if you are looking for more than just soundboarding to yourself. Anchor’s place the phone on your ears to record helps keep away insane attention from the insanity that you are doing. Maybe starting small makes more sense at my scale. Due to sheer lack of knowledge when it comes to editing audio. This bit might need strategies to create a better, and clearer episode.
One of which I think would be to record pointers in the comfort of your own room.


**Damage.**


We limit our view of others by the reality we can imagine for ourselves. In my lifetime, I have been boycotted, spat on, stoned, ambushed, assaulted, raped, and abandoned. Not been stabbed or shot yet. I told this to someone recently, and the response was, “All of that screams damage to me.” I hold a different view. This would have qualified as damage if I had chosen to whine about it. But I don’t remember feeling or doing that. The takeaway here is that we perceive the responses that people may have, based on a reflection of what we would do in a similar situation. That’s empathy. But empathy has a flaw.


Most of us are unaware or not remember often that everyone thinks differently. Thoughts are as different as fingerprints. No one thinks the way you do. That’s what makes us all unique. No one shares the same journey. No one shares the same resources. No one shares the same stories. Since we don’t keep this one in our minds when we go about our daily lives, we limit our view of others by the reality that we can imagine for ourselves. That’s assuming. But being assuming has a flaw.


Everytime you look at another, remember that what they may pursue as an ideal reaction or response differs from yours. The real stereotypes are the ones we hold about ourselves. These are not a part of what popular culture dictates. But more of what we wish for us, or think as ideal when we are posed with a new experience.
Awareness as such, is essential for happiness.


**Love.**


Love is like photo editing. Where you reach a point that you know there is more to be done by your standards, but the picture looks so good already that your standards fail to add to it eventually. Where the details cannot be better, where the thought of your first idea to be the best idea falters. When you have practiced so much that you reach a point where know bliss. Where the only thing that you can take away is; commitment, hard work, and an enduring belief in the present, and a future.


I would have never thought that an unremarkable image would mean a start of something so huge for me. The whole idea behind getting on Instagram was to document my work in progress, or to a certain extent documenting the work that I had done over the previous years. It may be a lot that can be ignored, but every day has so far come to me with a learning experience. The things that are possible in this world that we occupy, and the things that I have used now, and then to create a bright future with all those people who have touched my life. The entire intention now is to dump my personal experiences, and in simpler words, to maintain a journal here.


Not a daily one, but a journal that intends to add words to images, all in one place. So that when they come together piece by piece, I can publish my own book, or maybe fuck that! Creating for the sake of creating. Documenting for the sake of documenting. Leaving it all for civilization to decipher in the ways that time seems fit. The purpose of social media is not to hit a self set number as a goal. But to continue creating, and sharing a part of you. It is not to assign meaning to your life based on what you see in the life of others. But to see where you stand, and appreciate whatever it is that you hold.


Self love.


**Lost.**


This is a journal entry, not conscious of public discretion, in the now, or the future. I am afraid of the immense activity that I will have to put up with if I continue my not architectural job. I am afraid that I will have to face an existing piece of failure if I quit it. However, none of it let’s me do what I really want to do. The job does not give me happiness or the time to pursue those things that make me happy. The job does not give me any respite, despite the fact that the place is buzzing with people. The capacity to create would make it so amazing for myself since that is all that I want to do. As my handwriting seems to distract me, I am looking for objects/ ideas, thoughts to build a discretion around. What I want is no attachments binding me around my choices with time. I can write, I love to travel, I love creating Architectural design.


A part of me still doubts my love for Architecture. A part of me fears that there is much value placed on public opinion when deciding the course of action that I take. Often that’s not true, but more often than not, it is. Of this particular behaviour, I will need to be watchful. The best of me has come out in action when my aim, and purpose had not been built upon ideas of “What will look good on me?”. The best of me had often, and still comes out of the complete disregard of the above idea, and undoubtedly in the forgetfulness of it. The idea of creating for the sake of creating does not make me money even if it may serve the society with no addition of art. I had thought of building a delivery service that’s by the people, for the people, and of the people. The only hurdle here is accountability. Sometimes, I feel lost when it comes to deciding the next best thing to do.


The fact of being alone in my practice, doing everything from measuring sites with a tape, regular visits at a print shop, to handing over the keys to a client. These small essential tasks do not bother me. What has bothered me for almost a decade is unavailability of a person to soundboard. Options that vary from deep design discussions, to choosing what meal to order, or cook for lunch /dinner. I have spent years looking. Although the dull mood of everyday life makes such relations stagnant at some point, it has taken me quite a lot of time to realise that every individual is alone in their journey. And as you get closer to the top, every decision is a lonely decision. I have realised after tumbling around different industries in the search for a product /services, that the best ideas are often your first ideas. Usually the instinctive step that your mind tells you when you look at a person /thing is the thing to do that will get you the best outcome. Although most of life will ask a different version of you in the various stages of life, you are better off going with the flow. The plans that we often make are the second best options that are available at hand.
Thought is the most delusional aspect of everything. Thought can often lead us to believe that everything has a step by step program. But we fail to realise /consider that circumstances change. That human potential to deal with changing circumstances is infinite. The power, and nature to adapt is the sole reason why the human race has come so further ahead from the other animal species on this planet. Adaptability is the only lesson here. Executing your first thought or the instinctive idea that comes to you when you look at anything is the best step.


- *Somehow, your heart already knows what you need. — Steve Jobs.*


**Facebook.**


- *“Everything around me is evaporating. My whole life, my memories, my imagination, and its contents, my personality?-?it’s all evaporating. I continuously feel that I was someone else, that I felt something else, that I thought something else. What I’m attending here is a show with another set. And the show I’m attending is myself.” — Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet.*

Why should I do something about Facebook?


Here’s what I know.


Mark Zuckerberg, aims to connect the world. Well that’s such a noble thought. I couldn’t agree more. But then simply put, Mark is making money off me. With or without my knowledge can be a perfect place to start a debate in his favour, but. Do I need a friend who is as noble as a doctor, offers me chocolates, and then bills me for diabetic treatment?


This is what I think.


I believe that the way you do anything, is the way you do everything. This means that your failures/ successes will be same in every aspect of your life. This means that the amount of focus you put in brushing your teeth (usually the first task of the day for most people), is the amount of focus you will put in the rest of it. The amount of focus that you apply to your principles, are reflected in your habits. Your habits shape your weeks, day by day. All of these cycles of successes, or failures, start at every other action you make in your waking hours. I have a feeling your dreams count too. That’s why I dreamt of punching orders, and have certain nightmares which are directly synonymous with the happenings of a whole week. I believe that if self respect is a concern for you, then it should be a concern to the T. Read that as, “If anything is a concern for you, then it should be a concern to the T.”


Else I consider the lesser level of concern as hypocritical. I believe that any level of half heartedness is reflected back in every thing you do. So my question to you is, do you want a half hearted life? half hearted success? Oh! Thank goodness, that means your failures won’t hit you hard, because they are half hearted too. But then again, do you want failures? Coming back to “Do I need a friend who is as noble as a doctor, offers me chocolates, and then bills me for diabetic treatment?”


“No.”


Because of the vibe that kind of duality brings into my life. This is why I quit Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. To be honest, it is a matter of a question, more than anything else. To be honest, it is a matter of a revelation, more than anything else. To be honest, it is a matter of humanity’s future, more than anything else. Humanity’s future because posterity will carry the vibe, and that’s making everyone of us, “A friend who is as noble as a doctor, offering others chocolates, and then billing them for diabetic treatment.” That future, is something I don’t want, because I think, it is hypocritical to the T.


- *“So many people live within unhappy circumstances, and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new, and different sun.” — Christopher McCandless in Into The Wild (2007).*


**Influence.**


In my past, I was fired in situations as people vied for influence. I have been shown how important, this power over someone or something can be. Our world is shaped by influence. Free Will is an illusion. Some people are true bred consumerists for the reason that the market influences their own judgement to an extent that they consider their entire lives to be a product of free will. A close friend once told me that I was influenceable. That means you can influence me with ease. At that age, I found that reality bothersome. There was a need to control actions. A need to demonstrate control over life.


Now however, I realise that we are humans. Humans, by default, are influenceable. This sure is vulnerable. This, like any other vulnerability, is powerful. The power lies in knowing what influences you. Once you know what does, and how it does, you have won half the battle. The other half lies in catching yourself. The more number of things that you can find to have an influence over you, the more power you will have.


The ideas of fashion, beauty, and make-up are prevalent for a sole reason that these ideas are projected as a necessary element in human life in advertising. Popular media holds a large influence on human lives.
Mostly for the reason that it is popular. I find that toxic.


As you grow older, popularity recedes into the shaded patch down the memory lane. The things that influence you change. Your interests, hobbies, and decisions, are based on ideas that are not your own. If you are not careful, influence can suck you into living a life that you never really wished for. Self awareness is the antidote. Wish for wishes that make you burn as an individual. Wishes that make you rise up from those ashes like a Phoenix.


**Abyss.**


This picture reminds me of hierarchy. A man looks down on another, while being idle himself. The way this society prides upon its idle-being than those industrious-beings. With the background showing two buildings posing for the shot. Gaudy at their best, aspirational properties for those who lie in the foreground. If you look closely, the worker, and his tools are in the shadows. And the people who owns those posy buildings too. Remember that, all those who win are toiling away in the background. All work happens behind the scenes. The lesson here is that, “All work happens pre-season. Throughout your life you can see that those who are rich are so because they do the things that the majority are lazy to do. The fishermen can afford boats that cost more than your paycheck. The farmers own estate. Thinking about such paradoxes, I wonder if these men working on the foreground, were paid to be here buy the means that own these buildings. It is strange how men have structured civilization in selling everyone a dream, that even adults believe in. I am not against being employed. I am against not compounding my time with efforts that reap in perpetuity. That’s an abyss. Getting through this abyss means going hungry for a decade, and reaping your rewards in perpetual eternity.

**Mumbai Suburban Railway.**


I don’t know about you, but often I need more enthusiasm to jot down few words here. Maybe, it’s the accessibility of the platform. Although, Medium has an app, it’s not their fault. The trouble lies with the facet that writing needs space. It needs comfortable keyboards, quiet spaces, or rather spaces that inspire thinking.


Having stated the obvious, I will continue completing this article on my train ride. I have noticed a peculiar detail that the Mumbai Suburban Rail Network adds to the lives of the general population.


There is a thing about these trains that run around the city of Bombay. Most of these trains especially on the harbour line run late. Apart from the punctuality issue, there is a subconscious drive that is shaping the city.


The detail is an announcement. Whenever a train of 9 coaches pulls into a station that can occupy 12 coaches, they make an announcement.


- *“Yatriyon krupaya dhyan de. Platform no. xyz pe aane wali 12 debbo ki local, aaj 9 debbo ki aa rahi hai. Yatriyon Ko hone wali asuvidhase humein khhed hai.”*


This translates to


- *“Passengers please pay attention. The train arriving on platform no. xyz is of 9 coaches, instead of 12 coaches. The inconvenience caused to passengers is regretted.”*


The peculiar bit is an apology. The reason these trains are shorter than the length of the platform is not clear to me. Since the trains can be accommodated in the platform. The announcement seem to be unnecessary.


The apology drives into the subconscious, the idea that apologies are okay.


The emphasis on saying sorry, has been in my belief a cause for the attitude of the citizens to be complacent of the mistakes that they make. Millions of people wake up, and go through this idea driven into their subconscious day in, and day out.


A stark observation made alongside these factors is that people have a complacent subconscious. Our first response to the errors we make is sorry. Since, this is a concept common to the masses, it has made complacency a normal.
The prevailing attitude is reflected in all the business transacted in this city, regardless of the nature of the situation. Is complacency the reason that a majority of the local population cultivates habits that lead to beliefs such as lack of punctuality is an obvious Indian flavour.


This post was written to bring awareness about things that define the subconscious of the citizens every morning. It works with the idea that knowledge of a behaviour trait can help curb negativity.


Since, the way you do anything is the way you do everything.


The long term impact of replacing old habits with a new set of habits will lead to a happier, mentally healthy, and productive society.


**Has Bangalore Thought About This?**


I am from Bombay, and the two things that I have found to be missing in my rendezvous with Bangalore are, in my opinion as an architect, major reasons for the issues with traffic, and a solution to most anti-outsiders viewpoints that have been shared to me by most of the Uber drivers I have spoken to in this city.


Bombay does two things differently.


Let us take a closer look at what follows at rush hours. In Bombay, the way the city moves usually takes care of most traffic problems. When people leave from offices, the traffic is divided in a vast numbers into two major segments. Most people opt for the local trains. If you are a Bangalorean then this should translate as public transport. The rest of the crowd take to the roads, and use the Western Express Highway. Please don’t read this article, and build a fucking huge highway inside Bangalore. You don’t have the space for any expansion. Means of transport are one of the means to tackle rush hour traffic. But hey, Bombay does it because the British already did it for them.


I want you to focus your attention on the second thing. Bombay has a particular case of what I call the seaside effect. Because there is a seaside available in vast lengths for most of the citizens. They have spaces like Marine Drive, and the Bandra Promenade, and well that’s all they need.


- *You don’t have that in Bangalore. I am not talking about the sea. I am talking about 24x7 open, safe, public spaces for all. This can change your entire city in one smart move.*


Here’s how it helps.


When people leave from office, at say 7pm. Most people, especially those with families head for home. The rest, usually the younger generations, head for Marine Drive?-?If you are a Bangalorean, read this as the kind of public space I wrote about above. Not everyone goes to Marine Drive everyday, but you get the point — the population of office goers is split into two groups “home going”, and “chilling”. What happens is that the pressure on the traffic is now split.


- *Some citizens in Bombay have a tendency of leaving late from work because the traffic is lesser. These people either work hard, and drive a Porsche around on New Year’s Eve, or they go look at the sea, and do life talks.*


Talk about the sort of controversial debate on the anti-immigrant view shared by the Uber drivers?
Here’s what I see.


I understand that Bangalore is more open to social drinking, at least when compared to my circles in Bombay. Most of the pro or anti western culture talk that the Uber local drivers gave me are just a matter of perspective. I think they are the locals so we should all respect their cultures. My point here is simple — people tend to drink indoors more than outdoors. Because as an immigrant, I will explore my human nature to the best possible opportunities. This is true for anyone, anywhere. People tell strangers their deepest secrets, and fears. And people are more comfortable in risking it out on anything but their home turfs.


- *So if you light up your parks, and keep them public, most of the nuisance that these drivers keep talking to me about, are out of the window. That’s how people are. People will be what people have always been — that’s people.*


What you can learn is this!


Bangalore does not need wider roads, because they have no space for it, or matter of fact, I think spending taxpayers money on road widening is wasteful when you can (here’s a solution),


- *Build a public space, or redesign Cubbon Park (or any other space that can be walking distance from your business districts) to make it as safe as Marine Drive.*
- *The standard is that; if you go to sleep with your belongings open on Marine Drive, like flat down on the Promenade, no one will rob you — that safe. We don’t mess up on Marine Drive. Marine Drive is sacred.*


So give one public space to Bangalore, and it shall reduce traffic. It shall give people a space to mingle, and understand each other. It shall facilitate cultural infusion. This shall give you a healthier society in most respects. If you are serious about these things, then two more examples would be The High Line Project, and Central Park, New York would increase the acceptance of this idea by some folds. Since if small roads are a problem then bigger roads is not the answer.


**Waiting.**


The joy of waiting on stations is that you realise that no matter how anxious you get waiting, Time will fix everything. You may have 120 minutes to go, but there comes a time when you have only 12 minutes left. And it does not end there. Time moves on. Beyond T-1. It goes on till you are stuck again. It’s the same time that you stopped feeling anxious about. But it is back again. As if it is a thread connecting your memories all together. At Least the ones that you cared to remember.


Then why do we measure time? Isn’t it the ether that binds the universe together? The only thing that can change your story, if you begin to play with it. If you begin to alter it. All that talk about parallel dimensions is maybe that they are a part of the same universe. Maybe they are crests, and troughs of the waves. Like mountains, and valleys, that exist seamlessly. That seem to be from another universe because we are not watching from above the waves. Maybe the laws of physics are like people, or cultures from different parts of the same world. They exist, but we fail to see them for what they are, only because we did not see them through a lens: that they are all part of the same thing.


**Variables.**


The constant changes in variables that can be inclusive or exclusive of other factors are only as infinite as the human’s belief of infinity. We set our own limits. We set our paradigms. And we are held back, or propelled forward as we choose. Circumstances are merely a dream. Life is a dream. A dream whose limits you set. Acting based on the thinking that your problems will end in XYZ time is how long it will actually take for them to end. The only quotient that matters is the intensity of your actions. Intensity is not determined by scale.


It is determined by your belief in your actions. It is not determined by your motivation to act. But solely on how much you believe that A leads to B. Also note that if you have to get to E, then your life will pan out as A to B to C to D to E. But if you believe that A leads to E, then that comes true too. It’s all about your belief. It’s all about how real you think what others may consider absurd. But hey! If you think that your actions are absurd, then guess what, A will be absurd enough to not lead you to E. There is no grey area here. Everything is black, and white. Just as nature punishes a kid playing with a knife as much as it punishes an adult playing with a knife.


The rules are equally applicable to us all. We are all here. Only the time that we have spent here may differ. Our lessons may differ. The number of times we have bled may differ. But the human potential inside of us is equal. Human potential that you have is infinite.


**Balloons & Bubbles.**


How do you change the name of a city? — You start with the local bus pass. Let’s be clear about this notion that what you see, and what you get are often not the best of what we will see happening in life. Most things revolve around to land nowhere. That, in fact, is a good thing. You can choose to bounce around in ecstatic motion for a certain number of years, only to have learned, grown, and prima facie, evolved. Evolution is the sole purpose of life. It is not progress, but paradigm shifts that challenge dogma, and act as catalysts to any decision making to the extent of being subconscious. If our lives are an one time event, we might as well be vulnerable, and prick ourselves, only to fly around the room like a balloon.


**Smaller.**


If you have read Stupid White Men by Michael Moore, then you would know that Men demand bigger things. Not the women of our society, but the men. As far as I am concerned, smaller things work for me. The smaller the plate, the lesser will be the food I would want to serve myself, the lesser will be the wastage if I don’t finish eating. Also, I will be concentrating highly nutritious food on that plate now that there’s a limit I chose to run with. Smaller has an advantage. Much as the fable goes, David, and Goliath. You can complete daunting tasks by going one at it in bits. Bits, not pieces, see! That small.


**Slow.**


So there is this entire idea of slow. Oftentimes we comes across a point in life while making a broth that it turns out to be better if we just let it simmer, and boil up with time. Without a rush, or a haphazard frenzy to make something out of it. I feel that the secret ingredient to everything is time. We more often than not, forget about it. We rush to get things delivered. We rush to deliver things. We expect so much of ourselves, and others that we forget. We forget to live. We forget to enjoy the moment.


We forget to experience what the moment has to offer. We forget that no matter if it’s pain, and suffering, or joy, and peace. None of it will be served to us in the exact same way by life. So we might as well experience it while it lasts. We forget to feel. We forget how if you leave it be, and wait, then most things become so much better. This is true of love interests, passion projects, businesses, and even making Maggi noodles. Some things end, some last. The focus here is in not being lost in thought. The focus is to experience the moment, consciously.


- *Slow things down, and everything becomes more beautiful.*


**Scootsy.**


Today, let me share a short insight with you. After an influx of people in my life from architecture. dating apps, event spaces, or super-hosting on Airbnb, I have learnt these things. Things about successful habits, satisfaction in life, and generic human behaviours. Most people that I have met have been good at heart. Most people are searching of a piece that’s missing from their lives. They are all looking for an escape, albeit they cannot define it. For some of us, this search becomes life itself. That’s when you go person to person, thing to thing, looking for something. That’s when you splurge your money on shopping. But that’s not the answer.


A search for what fits, and what doesn’t will always leave you empty. Life is not a search for meaning. Life is a lesson in acceptance. Accepting whatever comes our way, and see how things work. At times, it’s starting new things, chasing a few others, or closing other ones. Life is an endless exploration. Aerosmith wrote “Amazing”, a song about it?-?”Life’s a journey, not a destination”. That’s the reason, I chose to work for Scootsy. So far, I have been able to figure that I find my escape in understanding habits.


Although, Bundl bought Scootsy, a month before I joined. Most of my well-wishers worry about the abrupt career change that I have made. I chose to work at a place full of people. People that come from different backgrounds, temperament, and life experiences. And experiences that fulfill the most humane needs that work can bring. Work that helps deliver emergency supplies, food, and merchandise in under an hour. In my experience, even the United Nations Resource Agency has not beaten this clock.


Here’s what I think is positive.


Scootsy’s delivery in a hour USP helps me condition my mindset to make quicker decisions, and execute them. This is contrary to what mainstream architecture good practices.


If you have seen throughout life, “The way you anything, is the way you do everything.” For example, If you suck at finishing your food, you will never be a cleaner. Read “Relentless” by Tim Grover to know what a “Cleaner” means. That’s the jackpot. This new mindset does rub off on other areas of my life. So, your seemingly uninteresting call center has taught me habits worth keeping. A habit of getting things done, and that of being proactive. These make laziness, and procrastination, non-existent in my vocabulary. Outside of Scootsy, they help me get things moving at other enterprises.


**Regret.**


I regret not having started Instagramming from the New Year’s Eve. This would have been so perfect. The Concord was the first racing push bike that I rode.


I have had the luxury of growing up in the countryside. Where the streets have no names. Where miles of ever-changing landscape surround you in perpetuity.


Pedaling faster to not be engulfed in a monsoon shower. Where every second’s pause would mean that the clouds would take over the dry country roads.


Slopes, and climbs are the frequent reminder of how life has it’s ups, and downs. Where beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.


Only if you could ease back from that frantic pedalling. Only if you could look around you. See mirth growing all around you.


Seasons come, and go. The landscapes don’t wither. Perhaps they change in shape, and form. Perhaps they have a different set of hues within the abundance of nature.


Perhaps they are the reason why I found peace in some of the most lonely years of my life. All you can think of is how slowly this world changes. How it is that the slower things go, more beautiful do they become.


The slower you go, appreciative is how you feel. Where the Concord comes to a halt. Where you can pause. Where there is beauty, and life. The wisdom to appreciate it.


Regrets come from wanting. A particular result. They are fears of the past. The cure for it, as for most things in life is gratitude.


**Reading.**


Reading for the sake of reading is no good. Reading for the sake of understanding is no good. Reading only helps as a means of collecting perspectives from different authors. True knowledge comes from comparing notes, tumbling around with the information we have so gathered, and applying to our own lives. You can have read a lot, and be astonishingly stupid, make dumb moves, and have gained nothing from it. Take my example for reference. Reading is an act of collection. The information once collected needs to be assimilated, and pondered over, and understood in the wide scale of circumstances that your mind can think of. This process of assimilation, and understanding can be best fulfilled by writing your thoughts down. In the exact way as a graphologist asks his test takers to write.


Being, continue, and end by writing your thoughts using a ballpoint pen on a piece of blank white paper. The idea is to have a non judgmental state of mind. A state of mind that is not driven by the influence of public or popular thought /opinions. The fact that the test takers have to submit this piece to the graphologist after their flow of thoughts end, requires them to have a considerable amount of trust in the graphologist’s morals. A similar trust is expected from you when you are jotting down your thoughts to paper. The whole idea being that your written word then would remain true to reality, lacking any outside influence, whether social, environmental, or spatial. Spatial reminds me that you must be alone, and your most comfortable place will you are at it. I could have scrolled up to add the previous sentence. Avoid such edits on paper.


**Etched.**


5 becomes 20, 20 becomes an age, age I spend with wonder, wonder that shall we ever remain the same, same as our fantasies, fantasies of lust, lust for a love, love for each other. Other day another time, time for a company, company of her, her thoughts plunder, plunder my restless soul.


**India.**


I live in a country, where if a soldier is shot, my countrymen fight, against each other, about should they go to war, rather than fighting with those, who shot that brave soldier.


**Running.**


Running across different plains, as we see the green pass by, with every turn in turn it stays, a high that drives our innate joys. I wonder if there is an end to all the things that seem to cry, there are not many things around, from an early sunrise to moonlight, that will bring a smile to my empty face, that will make me feel better inside. For today I feel so low, for every person, and every thing, that I have tried or given to, has crushed my inherent belief about myself. The only thing that shall save me is unknown, is unknown, is lost within an endless rhyme, and I am running to find out the why. But maybe I should just stop still, let the wind blow by me, show me what is that’s missing, let me realize. That every day, and every tide, comes again on a distant stride, we must make right all our wrongs, for this time is all we have, for this time is a blessing in disguise.


**Migraine.**


She said she wanted to make love, but not while we worked hither, nor this or that, nor here or there. She had another hundred clauses to spare, I wish her life was simple still, for now she is stuck between blowing horns, not the pace she wished for today, for the traffic made her miss her gig. Now she has to apply again, though this is happening for the third time, yet she blames me for her migraine, I wish she wasn’t stuck in there.


**Water.**


The lord looked at the water, it blushed, and turned into wine.


**Wish.**


I wish I could feel so much being constantly interrupted by life, there are few things here that can bargain for my attention. Tonight.


**Social.**


There was this one who found an answer to everything that I found lying deep inside cracked under the sun from an ancient shrine to an abyss divine. I thought so much for the future that lie, and a past that haunts tremendous baggages to hide, to let go with wonder, to find joy, with a vacay around the bay; tonight. I wish I could write better poems for now the city drinks itself to false joy in gulps of alcohol, and marijuana lit; there must be someone who goes beyond all wits, someone who can see, and holds to the hilt; those rules they made as in Sun Tzu’s times. Often we meet such random souls but that’s not our true self or a distant goal all of us crave for attention so much more that we crash into actions and people that are gore. Only to find that alcohol does not, does not find us joy, only hangovers for a moon, for when a new sun arises, and lets us know; there is so much more to life, and life in store that we might just drop the idea of drinking, and find our joys not in people, but ideas for sure.


**Closer.**


She heard a teardrop for she could now see all the vile things that drew her closer to him, and his voice seemed cropped, crippled by her teardrops.


**Cadbury.**


A smile turned into a frown as he expected some love to stay; for losing a like, and a request on Instagram meant more to him than his girl making chocolate milkshake.


**Writers.**


How writers fight in envy till they chip away their minds with worry of who liked whose insanity for as I look beyond their goals an emptiness awaits all that creativity.


**A Butterfly.**


A butterfly to remind you, that all is not lost. A butterfly that flew by, when you were lost in your thoughts.


**She.**


Wonder if a woman can give another the same things as she sought in despair that saved her life indeed.


**When I Lost My Father.**


When I lost my father I thought I saw it coming for there was thunder in the skies, and we had about a few hundred miles to ride. For any country boy, it seemed an arduous task but when I lost my father I thought I lost a part. I often think of the things we promised from travelling to being free, from doing no man wrong to standing by one’s misdeeds. There is still a faint memory of how I asked them to pull the plug for their was life but very little left in him on that summer dusk. For sometimes you have to make a call, that shall shatter you from within but as he said when he taught me to ride I stopped thinking to just do it instead. When I lost my father I lost a cricket match I had to beg for help for a drop to the nearest pick up point. When no friends would show up a rival had mercy for this is just a small world that most live by unseen. Now I wish I would have friends again with a chance to live my life not spend time on social but making better memories. I wish for another chance I wish I had a dream, and I pray that life will show me lest what I was taught is real.


**7.**


You will find your answer about 7 years after that point in time when you first thought about it.


**Brida.**


I wish there was a way to say or see the things that you are as I trod my favourite curve or see you limp on a path. There is so much for you to be so much for my words fall short but in you I see an angel in you I see a star as broken, and bruised you might be on you I see no scar. I see a glow that’s tender, innocent of the world afar, I see a joy so blissful, that my heart melts apart, and alone lies your blank stare that stops me in my tracks, and shows me how I blunder a search that I need not start.


**Lancymark.**


Thoughtful this be unlike random bickerings I wish some more joy for you as a cure for it all with a passing train on a railroad cross. Across a bridge lies my heart tonight this I know now since you wrote these lines I hope we all be found; found in the best of moods for life.


**3:10 To Yuma.**


I am now going to jot a film because most of my tinder dates have succeeded in disappointing me by showing an uncanny ability at flipping. Have you seen 3:10 to Yuma? That movie shows a protagonist do things even when he need not have to because he wanted to set an example for his son. And the antagonist willingly martyrs his companions to support the protagonist’s cause. These are the true stories that built a country like America. We should learn from it. And if you think it’s ancient, take Elon Musk for an example: that man says;


“When something is important enough
You do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”


I think it is not his quote because my primary teacher told me the same exact thing. My point being, my city needs a lesson on commitment, and I am going to give it to them. So far as an architect I am wholeheartedly disappointed in mankind, and angry at everything around me, and today I am going to follow through on my oath.


**Love.**


Oh my! oh my!
That value for love she had;
for she never had any.


**Magic.**


Magic happens when you don’t give up, even though you want to. The universe always falls in love with a stubborn heart.


**She.**


She distanced herself, to save herself.


**Small Things Matter.**


From a laugh to another sneer from a closet talk to banter dear. Small things matter beyond normal stature from a withering smile to constant telephonic chatter.


**Scripting.**


I have been looking across a window, and I forgot the words I had in store as I thought of what she would say more than what she wore. Ain’t that the way it’s supposed to be the way we should admire beauty I guess the thing that we lack today is meeting people without any scripting.


**To Be Me.**


The only thing that I have to be is to be me. Not the me the world wants me to be. Not the me my friends want me to be. Not the me my wife wants me to be. The only thing that I have to be is to be me.


**Memoir To The Old Man.**


So today I went to the post office to ship a parcel Internationale but the lady said come tomorrow for the tailor wasn’t around.


**Chance.**


From a tiresome decision to another chore take a chance someday. Follow your original detour this might backfire pretty much the same but you won’t have regrets on any other day.


**Inside.**


Because they are not straight the nosing is off but you were taught here, and you don’t know a lot but since we all have been to such a place. Hopefully we try to escape every other terrain jot down our thoughts on drawings instead. This is not my poem but people don’t wait they don’t know what was destined for every other thread. You can rant along but this is not a rant this is realising that in the end the only way that you will find answers is to look inside.


**Brida 2.**


I told you I am a filler but I have never told anyone what I think about myself, and to me it just means that I am stressed. And these thoughts are leaking in fragments, and I am telling them to you because I have never taken any one to theatre or a dining out too.


Hell I have had many dates many more than men can count but to you I can pour my heart out. Hell I have had women ready with makeup, and all in the same room as me but I canned on them still such guts I have held but it all vanished when you were around.


I have always felt like a filler some friends said it’s nothing but emotional baggage, and I have tried but in vain. I know cures to most things that trouble a human heart but an answer to this I cannot tell.


I wished to see you romantically of course but then you are just 18 I am almost a decade older, and you wanted a friend. So I am trying to tell myself that I cannot do to you what I am looking for myself for ages since.


I want a person just a person to crash but it’s a lot of emotional baggage attached. I have tried my best to keep this within me but the idea that scares me is that of regrets again.


Of not telling you this, and parting away, and never know what it might be if things work a bit differently ages hence. I am so confused though my face doesn’t show I cannot see beyond you anymore.


Most of my answers for life lie elsewhere but the thought of your absence pain me so much more. I am trying to hide it under the cloak of being friends, and I wish I can keep it that way but the pain hurts me to a point of numbness.


I know we work together, and you have these rules I am praying that the next few weeks will be gentler to me. I wanted to tell you, all of this tomorrow but I was losing too many people, and beautiful lines than my mind can remember to share.


So I am writing this down I am sorry again I wish you would understand I just want you to decide for us over my numb selfish mind doing the honours instead. I just want to be happy with what makes you stay for the idea of losing a friend hurts. It hurts beyond repair.


For I have helped a million people in ways different but none of them have valued it, and thrown me away. I don’t seek attention maybe acceptance is the word but I don’t want to cry for it like this week again.
It’s been so good of her to trust me with her shop, and her store but I don’t see what lies ahead. I am just so lost in an endless mystery but when it comes to the future I cannot see, anymore.


**Being Torn.**


Between a job or your own shop
Between money or that desire to hop
Even if it means that you might pretty much flop
Between being debt free, and poverty a top
Between a cage, and freedom of thoughts
Between what Jim Carrey said about his father
And what mom screams to you a lot
Between security, and your dreams of years
I am lost at making a decision dear
Between selling my art, and saving my soul
Between things that might last, and a risky endeavour.


**Harness.**


Today is sort of my last day at theblackcanvas_ Mummy returns at dawn, and I shall be gone. This cool pic of their camera harness reminds me a lot of my archer’s sling. Miss those days of shooting arrows in a Chikmagalur range.
And the bow just says it well. The nearer the better. The faster you pull your string, that larger shall you miss your game.


There is a thing this stint thought me. That slowness is the way to capture all beauty instead. Look at that amazing detail, I am sure must be driving all you wedding photographers insane. But the strength of a sling is in it’s straddle, and not in the bolts beware.


I wish that you order at least of one these masterpieces, for the fun of making them, goes beyond any artistic care. There is so much more to do, with these on your apparel, gear.
Watch that audience rhyme with envy, as you swing, and shoot with cameras dear.


**Heart.**


Put your mind over the bar,
And your body will follow.


**Death.**


So here’s what happens when you die
You close your eyes, and you see it coming
You imagine all the ways within that moment
Of how you can die.
You might be lucky enough
If you are stationary
As in in your bed, and not
Prowling on the streets /outside.
For then there is no action
Or reaction
To concur
That might cause your demise.
If you are lucky
You might see
The exact way
Held in time.
But there is a thing
About the future
It changes
Every time you look at it…
Because
You looked at it
So that’s why
Then you won’t die.
And you know you have won a victory
As temporary as it might be
A victory over death
For this thing happens to thee.
There is one nice little pain in your fingers
Almost like something is pinching inside
But with more nerve sort of feeling
Not an external desire.
That pain makes you want to be alone
Curl like a prawn, and feel your body inside
It makes you want; to be lost in your own thoughts
But then it subsides.
Whenever you have to die
A finger will pain
From that point
Near your palm.
Usually it’s your left arm
For most of your arteries, and veins
Go straight to the heart
From there.
And it will make you wake up
If you are not destined to die
Or if you have seen the future
And it changes for you that’s why.


**Collective.**


Some things in life need a lot more rhythm to it than you can beat. And that’s okay. So today I went to a movie screening.


There were thoughts being shared about collective work in the city. About how the people collectively make a city without any formal inspiration. Now I have a question. If the boundaries are to be dissolved, and the city becomes an ocean of collaboration, where, and how does one creative mind find individuality /Identity of a creative expression? Any Thoughts?


**Canciones De Un Incendio.**


Que todavía se hablan, si usted sabía que yo no podía oír de usted? Supongo que lo haría, y por lo tanto sería I. Sus huellas se borran, por el aullido de los vientos; Y, sin embargo, usted respira canciones de en el aire que nunca se me va a tragar, Y yo todavía grabar su nombre en las piedras que nunca de la banda de rodadura.


**Trainspotting.**


What the fuck is this guy doing? I am hungry. I need to go home. I need to go home.


**Of Pegboards, And Walkways.**


She is the most amazing piece of nature that I have ever seen. From the foothills of Kerala to Milky Way galaxy. The way she lets me be. And fights for a certain togetherness. A doubtful mind on a run from a tornado that was blessed. There is now sand in my shoes which she put there deliberately. I think I should shoot for the days are getting longer incessantly. Too many adverbs, yes too many adverbs is what we had. She left me in a glance, only to stay dancing with the trance. The beauty of her innocence leaves a mark surely. There has been none like her before, who dared to level up a friendship, it might seem plain, and simple, but a turmoil has died inside. For honestly my humble mind, cannot find peace outside of her reality.


**Slept.**


Someone slept for 2 hours, someone slept for 3. I wonder what joy I find, I wonder with glee, I wonder if the love for travel, is what I seek, to find a heart that’s free.


**30.**


But then I don’t want to stop, stop writing poetry, poetry that make that heart, heart of yours beat, beat on a brazen road, road to Eldorado maybe, maybe it’s all a dream, a dream that shall fade, fade away on day 29 or 30.


**Muse.**


Muse thou can be, but I need a lot of love making, to feel inspired, love making with travel indeed, so don’t you go there now, my heart shall burn if you don’t agree, agree to be a muse that does a lot of love making.


**The Last Supper.**


There are moments of surprises that dot our lives from eventful days to dinner dates. There are a few things that make an impression leaving an insight behind some that span a night or last a lifetime. Most of where we go depends on where we want to be. Learning to keep secrets with liars might be the safest bet or may not be. But the easiest wish to fulfill is to ask for a beautiful life for, for life, that’s a default way to be. Simplicity then is not a habit but what you see in every thing, everything for the future, and every thing that has been. Then everything around you grows in the life just got lucky way. This is how you give life meaning.


**Crashing.**


Somethings are worth fighting for, somethings are not, for some people choose the easy way, and in their horrors they drown you away. Some people write it on paper, burn away the rest of their souls, for love is not found in these things people say, in the things they tell you to make you like them, love is found in staying, staying even when the times seem tough, waiting for the hard times to pass, and begin again, not everyone will understand this for they are afraid, afraid that they might be wrong, about happiness or pain. For fear ruled their minds when they wrote about love, you see love is the opposite of fear instead, that’s why I don’t believe in these posts that don’t ring true to my heart, for my heart was not stolen, I gave it to you, to crush, and play all day, until you want to crash into me, and keep crashing again.


**Nadi.**


Badi mushkil se nadiyon mein nadi milti hai jo manzil ko paati hai. Nahi toh har lehar bas gun guna kar kho si jati hai. Khula aakash rasto ka sabhi rasto pe chal te hai. Magar kuch hai ke jinke saath raste bhi badal te hai. Ye girkar bhi nahi girte aur utthe hai nayi dhun mein. Chunauti se ye kehte hai chalo gaaye tarannum mein. Badi mushkil se nadiyon mein nadi milti hai jo manzil ko paati hai.

**The Highest Task.**


I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.
©Rainer Maria Rilke


**Nothing Has To Happen.**


Look at this photograph, how abnormal it is. A mixture of concrete mass, next to the sands, and the seas, or below the mountains maybe. This is what you get, when you place two extremes besides, you can feel the angst, even without a clue about the space. As for all of us in this universe, this thought goes beyond just photographs, and maps, and charts, and life hacks, and hearts. Personal though this might be, to me or to someone else, I have come to believe, against that popular quote,


“If it is meant to be then it will happen.”


Pause for one sec, and see for thyself: what makes you think, that we are all so special, that the bloody universe will spare, it’s resources, and time, to make things happen for thine? Honestly speaking, the universe doesn’t care, it has its own problems, well you might be the cause, for about half of them. So that kinda help, ain’t coming your way, not now, not ever. So please stop believing, in happenings, and leisure, will was right when he said,


“If you want something, go get it.”


Because the only things that might happen, are the ones you put on your Google Keep.


**Open The Skies.**


Open the skies, and see, how we can never be, a part of a planet, not one of these startups or me. If we see the way we live, there is not much we can do, about what starts, from technology. When we climb the sea, won’t we be swimming, like swans, and fleas, or have mystery.


**Wannabe.**


Why did she be, wannabe, if we had a way, would it be mine, coz the blame is, all of it. Wannabe, why did she be, wannabe, what lasts forever, never outlasts, our fantasies, coz our dreams die, all of them.


**Motherland.**


There is no sense in me, I wonder if you can feel, subtle substance in these, lyrics they call, in these songs that we cannot sing, if we could only hear the music, we wouldn’t need a guitar to please, our motherland. There are no trains to get home, there is just a long wait, for these men to work magic, and let us all reach the things we preach, day on, and day off, until the night screams for peace.


**Can you?**


Can you catch up tonight? or my imagination, is gonna burn my memory. Can we sit by the drive? or a soothing temptation, is gonna rape my melody. Can I see you in a different light? or my poetic expression, is gonna lose all theory. Can’t the world say goodbye? ‘coz in you my heart, has found my everything.


**Only The Paranoid Survive.**


Only the paranoid survive. I don’t think so. The best thing to do is to write. It helps you clear your mind out, seek some clarity, and to find yourself, lost in your own thoughts. There can be nothing better than keeping your head down, and tapping away at the keyboard. Funny how it used to be a typewriter a few decades ago. I wonder if all of us think of technology in the same way. There are a few of my friends who seek to escape all of it by banishing themselves off the internet, by finding solace in the silence of the countryside, by travelling in to the mountains. Maybe they are all correct.


Maybe the only thing we should all try to not do, is “undo”.


Maybe the backspace, and the delete buttons, have led us to believe, that you can retry, and restart in real life. That you can edit everything, and anything as many number of times as you like. But is that correct? Having the ability to preformat everything, and anything takes away all that is authentic about it. It takes away your wisdom, it takes away your thought, it takes away your focus, and in the middle of all that your fear will be lost, it takes away your courage. Courage. This is something I think is essential. For anything, and everything that the world should seek. Often I have had to remind myself that looking up from the keyboard, and into the screen makes my mind pause at a thought. It makes me paranoid. I bought a book yesterday. That famous one by Andrew Grove. I was looking for it for the past 9 years. I haven’t found the courage to read it yet. Some say that the book changed the lives of the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, and Steve Jobs. So for me that means it’s all about how to do business in any industry that screams technology. But that ain’t true. I am hoping for a new reality. The book goes by the name of “only the paranoid survive.” When I first thought about it back in 2007, it obviously hinted that when you are scared of failure, you will work harder to keep things moving, and eventually you will surpass failure. But hold on a sec. Nearly a decade later, now I think differently. I feel that surpassing failure can also mean getting the average grade of 35/100 to have just about made it. It also means that you haven’t learnt about 65% of what was in it. It also means that being paranoid has kept you in bounds, that limit your focus, and vision to the mere fact of what is necessary. It means that there is a chance, no matter how small, that you could have, and still can do the best about what you want. It means that facebook, and apple, and others who follow their paths, and ideals can be better. It means that the vast majority of us who dislike the ideas of overpricing a product might have not existed. It means that your true potential is locked away. Locked away nowhere but inside of you. In the moments when you are worrying about how your writing looks, how the idea of formatting in a certain way for a world that likes a certain way, how that comma you left behind, or how screwed up your grammar is on hemingway app.com. It is in those moments, when you look up from your keyboard. Because you are scared that your disbelief in yourself, and your own way of life, is a lie.


**Do you see?**


Do you see? The mist, and the mountains tonight?
Do you see? The wind that blows into the land?
Do you see? How beauty beat age again?
Do you see? The sails that ruin the rain?
Do you see? How sin can be found in the chords?
Do you see? The air that reeks of smell?
Do you see? How grammar changes the thought?
Do you see? The cold in the dark night sky?
Do you see? How bright these city lights are?
Do you see? These things that block out the stars?
Do you see? How no order this song has inside?
Do you see? How quietly can meta survive?
Do you see? It ain’t no fault of thine?
Do you see? Why you should never give up for some wine!


**Pass.**


Like the tree in the snow,
I wonder if we know,
Of what pain lies,
In these distant meadows.
I lost some range,
Of technology in a train,
With no connection to save,
I feel estranged.
But worry you not,
In the next lot,
Of the time that comes,
Even this will pass.


**Fuck.**


Fuck me while you can, fuck me while no one has their eyes on us, spoon with me till we have some life. Showers of youth in our soul, like a whispering gasp for a boner, and the sweet silence on a phone call, from decent talks to dirty sex, let us bare ourselves to one another, find a spark of love in our lust, and a climax with all the regret, and guilt of not having met, you before.


**Yawn.**


Yawn
whispered a wind
in my ear
breathing fire
till it disappears
How beautiful are you
like frozen gold
as music bellows by a rising yawn.


**Free.**


Of living with her. And spending every moment in her presence, shut the world out, and create things of immense cuteness (not babies, if you are there yet), I want to make passionate love to her, and get dirty in every passing moment, take her out to places, where we can hear the universe inside of us, travel with her crazy, adopt a dog before getting a child, sauna every morning, and together we mould a work free life.


**Let Me.**


Let me lose yourself in you. Behind those knocks on the door and sliding windows. There isn’t a moment I want, without your envelope, the smell of you body, the wetness of your skin, the curves that hold me, under your sheets, from winter nights to summer days, there is barely anything, that I want to not do with you, not want to feel in your company.


**Things.**


The things that are common to you, like windy mornings, starry skies, and old trees; beetles, strawberries, and doorbells; coffee, blue jeans, and summertime… are not common to us.


**Hope.**


Today I saw this hot hot hot chick at some shop in Sher-e-Punjab. Like cat eyes, fair, and she had a cold, Stuck in traffic. The share passenger, the cab driver, and me were being all Manjunath at her. Until people started honking. And I was thinking, good but my girl be better. Your eyes, and the way the light falls on your face, the way your skin glows under a haze, gives me hope, gives me hope.


**A Chat.**


It is just hard for me to find someone who has the same troubles as I do. And then ignore them for the longest while till they fade away into the shadows. I wonder if they can still see me, but I wish they returned. I don’t know how to tell you, show you what I mean, because every time I want to find love, love escapes me. I wish you are well, and achieve all of your dreams, I wanted to write you letters, to all the places that you will be. Do you even like me a bit, is a question that haunts me, leaving me puzzled every night, with calls being cut by thee. It is hard to believe anything at all, with those midnight kisses that you sneak, I wish you were for real coz my heart aches, at the thought of losing something like you and me. I have no clue how we will meet, if we don’t talk till then, there must be a way that you know of, but I ain’t half as smart as thee.


OK are you trying to sweep me off my feet, Because I ll have you know mister That I’ll be a bit heavy for thee
I don’t mind the weight of thee, when your thought scare me, to be distant, and far away from love in every living bliss. I admire you have a tact for poetry, but sometimes that is what kills, love, and lust, and breds anger forever, in something as subtle as we. Can I have your address? Something where you will always be, even if we don’t meet, and blah blah, that’s where I can write to see, seduce you through my words atleast, if not by my KGS.


There is no tact in poetry It’s just lazy As is everything, Including you, and me, As there is no subtle we. Let me tell you a story, My paths crossed with a guy, Let’s call him dick, He was cute, and all But I am not sure we’d click But now as I write this, I think maybe it’s something, I guess i’ll have it in place of nothing. Write to me …
That’s real address forever


That seems made up in the eon tonight, just to keep me separate for thee, must be for good, because you wouldn’t have made the effort, of writing a poem back to me.


This is me, from eternity, in the search of an reply from thee, maybe we could write poems, and publish a love story. I agree many have been written in the memory of glee, but let’s make ours stand out of time, with our secret little relationship. Now don’t you go out there, and label, brand our relationship with sex, I am just using the word in a broader sense, and there shall be other things to feel.


I have written a few line of love, disguised by lust in this midnight journey, I hope the reach you, and find you well, or maybe I should just change my metric.


I want to write, a poem a day, it might be shit, but that’s okay.


Let’s write our texts as poems, and publish them on medium, maybe it will work as the bond, to keep us together, and from falling apart. What say of this whispering, that my mind has begun to speak, shall we find each other, and love through the means of poetry.


**Song.**


Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na
koi kaise
koi kaise


Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare
ude aise
ude aise


Ke jahan mein
na toh koi
dekh paye
jo hai zaroori


Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na
koi kaise
koi kaise


Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare
ude aise
ude aise


Kahi tune
jo ye jaana
reh jaye
ye zamaana
Tere piche
Tere piche


Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na
koi kaise
koi kaise


Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare
ude aise
ude aise


Kahin apna
jo nazara
na dikha
ye dobara
Chahoon mein
Tumhe kaise
Tumhe kaise


Ye toh tu jaane na
tu ye pehchane na
koi kaise
koi kaise


Yaaron ke faasle
faaslon se pyaare
ude aise

**Caffeine.**


When you have balls
That seem to erode nicotine
Pass through the smoke
Don’t settle for caffeine.


**Eclectic.**


Losing poems
In my sleep
Why do mornings have to be
So eclectic.


**Curb.**


Wishful thinking
Red lights blinking
Inching slowly for the curb
Better walk than run over.


**Instagram.**


Did something happen to Instagram?
Or is it just me?
Everyone be decluttering
Peer pressure maybe.


**Smoking.**


Smoking to keep away my hunger
While the pain fuels my curiosity
As it lingers.


**Happy X Sad.**


There was a thought in my mind about randomness. Have you ever noticed that there is nothing that has an order. Even chaos theory needs you to look for the pattern before you can see anything. Isn’t the idea of essentialism lost here? If every time I need to find the pattern then am I not forcing the trend?


There seems to be little that is diurnal when it comes to routine. In my entire commute from work to home, I have caught myself being in the exact same position at the exact same time observing the exact same time only thrice. I believe “Deja vu” is sheer coincidence.


This is what happens when you have a lot of ideas roaming around in your head. There is very little that actually matters.


Most of those ideas are media, and popular trends. The result of which is the absence of mind. How many days can you remember? Days when you could describe the events that happened “as is”.


Most of us cannot recall events before a week or two ago. If you are a social media addict millennial then even that’s a lot to ask for. No wonder our society is breaking up, relationships seem harder, and ideas like “the frequency of conversation needs control” exist.


Humans are social animals. I think they are more of political animals. They realized that being alone is not the best of the worlds. So the political mind suggested being social was the solution. Our world is taking that too far. There is a saying that I hear often.


“Too much is too bad.”


The idea of making everything social loses the point. There are places from cafes to spaces that binge on the idea of being social. They are clearly missing the point. If you are always going to be in a space filled with people, you will never appreciate the people. At times, you won’t appreciate being alone. Have you ever wondered why promenades like Marine Drive feel nice? That’s your mind telling you something.


Listen.


The times when you are most hit by depression is right after a Big Party. Drained of energy, and a low mood are something that will govern your life until the next Big Event. This is why people rush from one event to another. They are running from themselves. Maybe not everyone of is happy with what they might find when they are alone.


A bookstore in Cairo made a space that allows people to scream the stress out. It is a good thing. But the better thing would be to live in a society that does not need such devices to keep sane. I am not blaming them but it goes to say a lot about the world we live in.


We need spaces like those but only until we feel comfortable about being without them. The idea here is not to be a recluse. It is balance. With a constant stream of joy. Now, the first thought that might come to your mind is that wouldn’t a bit of sadness be needed to maintain balance? My answer is No.


“Sad is the opposite of Happy.


Happy X Sad.


Joy X Sorrow”


We all aim to be happy. Happiness is a temporary thing. It comes with the other side of the coin: Sadness. Instead if we focus on making an effort to keep joyful, our minds will be full and our hearts will feel content. And that’s good.


**The Changing Point.**


After following through the process, most of us might find that the dreams we were following or dreaming about are based on a pseudo wannabe idea of acceptance. By the way, three things:


- Start companies back to back.
- Don’t worry about the next move until someone shows interest.
- Essentialism is a good thing for routine. But not for creativity.


**Alone.**


Thank you for the inspiration. It is things like these that make me keep on going even when all the odds are against me, and the future of all my dreams seem bleak. On days when every motion you made seemed to have hit a dead block. These words you write make every moment worth reliving.


Honestly, I haven’t read all of your post but the words I picked on when I scrolled down until here gave me enough to wake up from the middle of my sleep, and drag my mind into a pool of wretched commitment. And I mean no disrespect. All I can say is “You should write more.” It keeps guys like me going.


As we feel direct influence, the people of our planet will soon see an impact of your work.


Thank you a lot for pulling me out of timid safety.


**Firefly.**


This might be late but realize
It is too hard to write,
When you are happy,
Coz’ there are so many thoughts to catch,
Like butterflies in the night skies,
Or was it a firefly!
I wonder why was every night
Memorable
That I spent
In the company
Of fireflies.


**Mohave.**


Out in the desert,
as a wind blows,
she saw in herself,
angst some more.
She could write stories,
some of her own,
of the past few weeks,
some months old.
A cold wind blew her dinner,
from those embers as they glow,
but she couldn’t care less,
she felt sore.
With all the tech around her,
to carry or hoard,
is it not a lot on your baggage,
to lose some, and snore.
Someday with unforgiving loneliness,
time will solve it all,
as you pass through Mohave,
through heat, and cold.


**Greeks.**


Even today, if the Greeks fall. There will be violence. Specks of mutiny as tiny islands on the world map go on to show the world how individuality can bring about a significant change in the world we live. No matter how absurd a thought. 


It is Powerful.


**Startup Culture.**


Start ups are businesses that are still figuring out:

1. Who their customer is?
2. What purpose they serve?
3. How do they make money?


**Point.**


I hit a point in my life, when I realized that there were fewer days ahead of me than there were behind me. So every single day ahead is the best day of my life.


**Spooning.**


How I wish to spoon, 
And massage her back, 
At the same time.
How I wish to spoon, 
And grab her ass; 
At the same time.
How I wish to spoon, 
And feel her hair;
At the same time.
How I wish to spoon, 
And kiss her neck; 
At the same time.
How I wish to spoon, 
And find her a robe; 
At the same time.
Oh! How I wish to spoon, 
And tear her clothes; 
At the same time.
But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ my vision will blur out; 
At the same time.
But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ my fantasies will come out; 
At the same time.
But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ I will fall in her arms, 
With the same joy.
Asleep.


**Bullets.**


Not a friend or a foe came to help him in his disruptive times. He was there for everyone meeting people, and finding friends again after 15 long years. But there he was all alone lonely when they put bullets into his heart.


**Norfolk.**


Six days out in the wilds of Norfolk was something I hadn’t done since I was a kid. Being in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, and no phone signal meant we had no choice but to relax, something that I find hard to do, and enjoy the scenery.

**Tattered.**


“Those men who roam in tattered clothes are often the ones who make sure that the cities have plenty to eat.”


**Lone Tree.**


A lone tree standing at the edge of a cliff is not all lost, and lonely. It is what holds the cliff together.


**Intelligently.**


“If we share, everyone can have enough.”


We believe that every society has enough to feed itself. Everyone will cherish what they create by sharing. The common man’s contributions through the internet will override all existing means of thinking. GRÜHAM is a “build” event series that builds shelter to meet the needs of a community.


We build a WikiHouse because of the community building that comes out through the process. All our data is freely shared on GitHub. You can fork it, and give back something more to our world. Doing more “build” events will meet the needs of our civilization. The sharing economy will become powerful enough to end most of what pandora’s box had led into our world.


“Contribution changes, not the life of one individual,
but part of your life too, May be our planet.”


Now you can be a part of this movement too. Maybe, we won’t change the world. Let’s begin here.


**The Joy Of Not Wearing A Seatbelt.**


Today, I travelled in a local train. My mind went out with glee.
Today, I travelled in a local train. Six months later you see.
Today, I travelled in a local train. I enjoyed the crowd. 
Today, I travelled in a local train. Emptied my mind aloud.


For six months, I took an uber. To travel in the city.
For six months, I took an uber. To save some money for me.
For six months, I took an uber. For hours in traffic.
For six months, I took an uber. How crazy can that be.


For an year, I worked on a project. No, not two or three.
For an year, I worked on a project. A dream since I was sixteen.
For an year, I worked on a project. I am now in the core team.
For an year, I worked on a project. I cannot believe.


The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. Feels wild, and free.
The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. Feels like a local maybe.
The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. Opens the mind for me.
The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. I might meet god instantly.


P.S: The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. Try it only in a train.


**Hard To Imagine.**


I was looking at youtube videos on Steve Jobs. Most of them displayed how self appreciation was a key to better marketing. I wonder if anyone else feels that way about Steve.


I did some browsing, and reading here on Medium. Lot of good stuff I must say. It made me think of all the things I should focus on — the businesses, the next step, the blah blah, and the needs to get done. Period. I wondered if at all I had to begin that list from it’s end, I will get to a point where the rest of the list becomes invalid. I believe that what needs to be done is something we all can imagine. Rather it gets done because we can imagine it. Ain’t that easy, human?


**Shower.**


I dare you, to notice detail. Right from when the first drop of water that hits your face when you wake up in the morning. The feeling that it evokes on your skin, and if you can try, all the way into your tissue. The amount of focus this requires. For you to slow down your time, and observe, to see, to feel, to understand, to discover. The way every drop of water splashes around it’s own body, and make. The reflection of light, and the mirror image of the faucet. To know, and understand that there is beauty in all things. That the most beautiful things are those that often go unnoticed. With every passing sound, when even silence is a sound, can you hear your mind’s quiet?


Feel the white ceramic as it clears your mind as porcelain, until you are left with nothing but that one thing you cannot undo, you cannot forget, you cannot ignore or you don’t want to quit. That my friend is your calling. The only thing that makes every seed of pain redundant. The mere thought of which gives you a joy to die for. And yes. Life is about joy. Not emotions, not sorrows, not thing like shopping what you don’t need. Joy is deeper than happiness. It is what you feel when the music flows from your pores, not from your larynx at bathroom singing. Where you actually see time freeze, while you make circles around your universe or anything that you can imagine. Today, I dare you; to take that shower.


**Khamoshi.**


Teri meri khamoshi mein
Khoje hum tumhe
Teri meri khamoshi mein
Kyun khoje hum tumhe


Kyun bhala mujhko hai yakeen
Pyaar ki rahon mein chale
Kyun bhala mujhko hai yakeen
Pyaar ki rahon mein chale


Iss kadar sochoon main
Kya dekha hai humne
Iss kadar sochoon main
Kya dekha hai humne


Teri inn adaon pe hum
Jaaneja jaan bhi mar mite
Teri inn adaon pe hum
Jaaneja jaan bhi mar mite.


**Jhuki Nazar.**


Mere janeja tu mujhse pyaar kar 
Kabhi maane na tu intezaar
Jhuki nazar 
Kyun jhuki Nazar


Tere bin mujhko na aitbaar hai
Duniya se mujhko aitraaz hai
Jhuki nazar
Kyun jhuki nazar


Meri yaad mein tu na khud ko kho
Teri zindagi ko tu khulke bol
Jhuki nazar
Kyun jhuki nazar


Ye jahaan karen intezaar tera ab
Kyun na jaaye tu ab unke sang
Jhuki nazar
Kyun jhuki nazar.


**Paid.**


This year I got paid for; Airbnb, Architecture, Art, Bookmaking, Clothing, Data curation, Film making, Furniture, Manufacturing, Photography, Songwriting, Startups, Vocals, and WikiHouses. So, dabble in things, that might make sense to your innate being. Don’t bother about what the world thinks, because everytime I told them say, that I was doing this new thing, they had their own version of criticism or marketing. So trust your heart blindly, and teach your brain to do so. Because the brain is a database you see, that’s trained to get you the correct answer on its first thought, which again always comes from the heart. All the best, and have faith.


**A Collective.**


I have spent my last three months trying to declutter. I have changed the way I live at least two dozen times. Right from the houses I live at, to my work profiles to my collection of books, my games, my documents — even my bank accounts, and stock collection.


I have noticed that most of the changes in my personal assets make a rare dent in the lives of people around me. I consider this to be a lucky effect of being free. The hardest part of the process was — as opposed to my imagination: everything soft aka online.


I moved content to, and from my laptop, phone, and two 1TB SSD drives. Also, Archinect, Behance, Eyeem, Facebook, Flickr, Freelancer, Instagram, LinkedIn, Medium, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, Vine, and VSCO.
The idea that I began with was to read/see/listen/learn, and delete. Stuff. The idea was to not hoard anything. Soon keeping things in check became harder, especially with the ever increasing hustle of the 8 odd email addresses I need to manage. As a result, I lost my girlfriend, and a lot of common friends.


I am on a month long break — at least that’s what this is. I have been up nights in a row, trying to keep up with the progress at work from the interns to the architects who work with me. Until one of them had to see a neurologist for reasons undisclosed. It is freakish what the team had been going through. What I found was keeping me insane was this thing I started — the decluttering.


A colleague once told me how her native language lacks gender differentiation — It hit me.
The thing with doing away with most of what you own — tangible, and intangible is just a part of the solution.
What most of us had been missing out on was our belief in segregation. — the kind of organization achieved by sorting systems into criteria.


The first thing I did was to make a page. Filled in on everything I could in the social media section. Sometimes being open about the blunders that can cost you heavy does you good. My social media lady felt this was pathetic. She believes that apps come with a predefined purpose — for example, she says Tinder is for sex. I disagree. Tinder is to meet people. What you do there after is not of Tinder’s concerns. If a society is branding it as a hookup app, then there is something that should concern you about the said society.


The second thing I did was to dump everything on those 1TB SSD drives. I was sorting files according to extensions, not projects, not clients, not dates . After all, what’s that search tool made for! This did free up one SDD — That’s progress.
The next thing I did was to dump everything on an inventory account on slack. I feel sorry that GitHub has that 25MB upload limit. This has now made all my work cloud based; for free, and for an infinite time. Now since everything is on the cloud, I can live appliance free. I travel with just 1 book in my bag. As far as decluttering goes I have to deal with only one thing — the page.


Since I have made a collective out of my everything, every kind of separation has ceased to exist. Life is simpler — maybe something the Americans can learn from.


This is hard to understand for some of us, but soon you will start to get interesting — something like Twitter.


**The Idea Of Sharing.**


Today I was talking to a very influential community host. I have always wondered about the ability a non profit might have in functioning without any hindrance. Hindrance from things like funding, and laws. I have always wanted to be someone who draws up a list of people who need shelter, and just go build it for them. More of, “Do you want a house?” — “Yes!” — “Tell me where do you want it, and I will build it for free.” I understand that this must be an architect’s fantasy. Maybe, I am dreaming. But after having zigzagged over commercial, residential, and pro bono projects, I have come to believe that there is peace in it.


I must have been sleepwalking when I did not see the obvious merits of the Corporate Social Responsibility law that they passed back in April 2014. It allows anyone to seek funding from those who are now legally bound to share 2% of their profits towards social causes.


I could have opened shop as a not-for-profit organisation, and got done to work. Instead my focus had been on doing so without any external funding.


Walking either path is equally hard. The not-for-profit one, more so. I have always spent a considerable amount of my day reading up on the for-profit section of our economies. Since 2006, that’s almost 40% of my life on the planet. So now a transition has to be decided upon, and a transition I have no idea about.
I am stumbling upon certain articles that talk more about the who than the how or why. Information on social enterprise seems to be guarded. I wonder why. The idea of sharing, and the idea of sharing ownership are entirely different concepts.


The former a pain, the latter, a relief.


How hard can be getting funding from CSR be? My friends say that it is either begging on a corporate doorstep, or building a brand on Instagram — the idea of being interesting enough for people to invest in your endeavours.
Maybe social norms prefer what exists — but personally, I prefer CSR funding without having to ask for it, just because there is a law that states it will be available for my social cause.


**Seeking Clarity.**


This might sound like whining. It is just a train of thoughts. Sharing it anyways. I couldn’t agree more about the variety.


In India, there are a lot of people/ cultures/ languages/ lifestyles. Here, the vernacular/age-old methods of construction work best. I am curious about how can I deploy the WikiHouse here. People have strong faith in the vernacular styles of architecture. The masses prefer concrete for the invariable speed, and the unskilled labour it requires. // Concrete-based construction pollutes the environment a lot more than we know. I know this information is dicey. While making sketchup models, prototypes, telling the open source concept to my clients. I have found that I somehow lack a sense of clarity.


Clarity as in: Why do we not approach improvisation by working on what exists? equation: vernacular + research on vernacular = improvisation. It seems to me that we are trying out the equation: WikiHouse + vernacular = solution. Seems to be a forced derivative as a process. Now, if we want WikiHouse to be the free, shared way of constructing a house at a global scale. Then we need to find common ground between mediums. Otherwise, my local carpenter has found more efficacy in what we intend to do in the trade. Even when we did those side walls with timber members, I felt betrayed.
Well we definitely had to repurpose those doors, and windows to justify that move. I feel there is a way that lets us build more than part-WikiHouses. WikiHouse as a method where anyone can pick up any commons folder. Go to the local hardware store. Find a cutting tool not limited to CNCs — as CNCs are hard to find. Build themselves a full fledged permanent shelter in under a week’s time. The idea still fascinates me. But there is a glitch. We need standardization.
Of components, techniques, material sets based on — as you might be aware of — climate. Comments — as of now all I see is the text is moving around in circles.


Summary: Clarity of direction. To be deployable by an unskilled labourer or not. Standardization of elements. Design styles based on climates. Shoot! “We often tend to forget what we do. There are so many of us doing the same things in their own little ways.”


**Money.**


Money is strange.


The more I earn, the stranger it gets.


**The Who, Not The Whats.**


These folks ask me what the key is to building their career is — what’s the next thing they ought to be doing. And I usually frustrate them by answering with questions: What are you passionate about? What sends you springing out of bed in the morning? What is it that brings out the absolute best in you? What is it that inspires you? What do you want to do for the world? What would you do if money was no constraint?


What do you want to be remembered for? What do you want your legacy to be? Think about these questions — the answer to these questions are all about who you are, and may help you discover what you want to be, and what your next step should look like.


**Space Aching.**


Time, space, place & play. Often we seek spaces that resonate with the depths of our darkness. A reflection that is subtle like the glow of a street lamp. Our most memorable moments are hidden in these alleyways. Their influence transpiring all space, and time. A space that is a replica of our mind. A time that is mind play.
A place where the wind blows the fuel inside our thoughts.


Like a setting sun under a bridge, and the cold wind upon nightfall. Find me there at peace for eternity. When the quiet stays unbound. Willingly as it may seem, without the clutches of being time bound.
But I have often found that addition of an architectural piece in a village’s fabric does some keeda with the people. Their sense of freedom which lies in the fields, and the countryside now feels challenged by the staunch neatness of the new neighbour.


They aspire to be that neat. They aspire for that progress…materialistic progress. But hasn’t human aspiration always been about discovering, and experiencing the new? The stuff that we speak of wanderlust, and living like gypsies? The desire to travel? Does all of it fade away in the pursuit of beauty in other things? Is this what is happening to this city?


Now, I am not against big bank balances. But is the purpose of it fundamentally flawed? Is it questionable? Is it a clear ‘yes’? Is Mumbai losing itself in the materialistic version of the human adventure spirit?


**Bullets.**


He shouted, “No Bro, Wait!”


As he could see his silhouette disappear into the dim space. Just a street lamp to decorate the street. Make it look like an alley. He wanted to run into it, and feel alive. The panic in his heart set him free, froze his body as another chilled wind made him pause. To take it all in, and observe that pause, and capture the memory like a photograph before it faded away in the myriad of his neurons. He had too much to think, too much to sort through, and the anxiety was not helping him at all.


**The Locus Of All Focus.**


There isn’t much that we don’t know about life. There has been a lot that is written on it. Very little read. The idea is to read a book a day, try a new meal a day, do the only thing you love for a living, scrap all other plans, and write. Simplicity then, is not the key, it’s the only way to do things right.


**Roads.**


So what happens when people are friendly, almost to the extend that they feel like a soulmate. But when they return from their travels things appear different. They have this exterior grim face that appears unwarranted for. When we happen to declutter, a lot. We realize that greatest joy is in our work, not in solitude, not in human companionship or human deeds, nor in our travels, and dreams. John Lennon quotes,


“Life is what happens to us… While we are busy making other plans.”


I have found that travel has become a way of life for most of us. At least a way of life to aspire for. But there is one thing about all of the hype that strikes me odd. You will understand why I call it a hype, hopefully by the time we get to the end of this post.


I have met many people who have travelled to almost all of the continents before they hit their 20s. Now, since I was raised on a farm, my initial train of thought was to believe that since these people travel, they would have an exposure that makes them mature enough to know, and understand the meaning of life. At least shouldn’t that be the case?
But I find these people despising a road side tea seller, for the reason that he is selling tea by the wayside. They seem to be oblivious to the fact that that is a man trying to be an honest living. I find these people complaining about traffic, about the events that happen in their lives, and about the place that they are at.


After having met just about enough some 20 odd year olds, I realised why did all the traveling their parents paid for did not help them with any sense of empathy. And the reasons are pretty simple:


Their parents paid for most of it.


They lived at places comfortable enough for a family to be at, which goes to say, they have always been exposed to the bright side of our civilisation. They have not seen real pain, real hunger, real emotions with no motive or gain. They have travelled, yes. But they have seen not. They have seen the tourist places, and all the hot spots. They have seen the temples, and culture, but not the poverty, the slums, and the rot.


They have been inside the comforts of a vehicle, and not on foot on a sidewalk, or stranded alone at a deserted station with not a known soul in the place they have been, nor have they seen the efforts made to survive a journey without the luxuries of a human hand to help them out.


I remember once a friend quoting, “the roads they gave us a lot, but they also took a lot from us.”


I never knew what she meant, until this day. Just a gist of it, that my mind plays with, is what I have seen, and learnt from all these travel craving people around me.


**Clocks.**


When you are working from 8 PM to 4 AM every night, it is hard to realize how much of the news you are missing. I did not realize what the UK, and EU were upto until one of my colleagues popped the tripling of google searches on the topic, 17 hours after the vote was cast. Sometimes I feel that was a stupid thing to do. But maybe they were all being smart by checking for changes on the www. The point is I don’t think keeping the know how of the news is important enough.


If it matters to you, your friends, and family will tell you about it. People in most of the places I have been to work complained about the amount of attention my work received. I should focus more on resting they said. But have you ever given it a thought? If you are going to an office, you are going there to create something, maybe destroy something — once I worked at a cafe where they taught me how to peel of oranges beautifully, they said. How sad! I love oranges. That was pure destruction. I quit in a week — but you go there to get something done. Isn’t it obvious that you don’t stop until it gets done? Where did these ideas of rest for the sake of closing time come from? Blame the Industrial revolution for it.
Most of us wait on the clock for that bell. I believe that by noon, most of us forget that they woke up this morning for bringing in the light. Most of us forget that they got out of that bed for a reason. But the few who remember don’t get to the sack until they are done.


How much do you work? How many hours of a week do you put in? These questions hardly make any sense when to a few of us. The ones I met did not wear watches. They would ignore the artificial sense of time, and go from one task to another. They would rest when they were waiting for updates.


Things like someone on the team sleeping the night away would annoy them.


Sometimes I think this is idiotic. But then if you look at the progress they made towards things like financial freedom was phenomenal. These people did not work with the world’s dogma of a clock. They ran a measure of time beyond the cycle of days, and nights, but one that was defined by project deadlines. Projects that were defined not by the money they made, but by progress. Progress towards living life without having to work for the rest of it.


Astonishingly, most of these people are kids. 21 or so in age. And they are travelling, the world, unbound.


**Mind.**


It is funny how our mind works. It is funny how we can tell a lot about people in the first instance. Our brains are databases, designed to give us a match from it’s storage for all our queries. That’s why most of the time we find that the design solution we began with is usually the best answer to any given problem. I read this in one of the books from the Bourne series. I have found this to be true but then again, maybe what you believe in is what you will see.
“How you do anything is how you do everything — even the way you wash utensils. Whether you choose to focus on cleaning the murk or do you focus on doing it till you run out of soap.”


A Hungarian friend once told me that the way someone eats at the table is the way everything you need to know about someone. Maybe that’s why dates are dinner dates, and we close deals on lunch. I thought of starting this article from here but then I drifted, and now I am being meta about it.


How we write, tells so much more.


Our mind is fascinating. It can see beyond itself, be the observer or the subject or both. This is what has always amazed me. The way it searches for that one word which will fit in the context. The search for a word, that search for perfection, and the way it always attains it. This might be a hint so as to why perfection is not a myth. Maybe we have not learned to recognize it.


The mind can see words sprawling, lying there in the vast emptiness of its own imagination. Can you feel the ever tightening grip of that emptiness on your brain? Can you feel how when you rush the way you write, the nervousness of the brain to find the perfect word to feed the rush? Maybe we can say that the brain feeds to itself what we feed it. Sometimes even when we stop. Maybe this is true, “Which wolf will win? He replied, “The one you feed.”


It has been my experience about most of the thoughts I have had on certain days. Days when my belief in everything around me is so high, for I can step without looking back or flinching a tad bit onto a blazing freeway, and experience no harm come my way. The thoughts that run through my mind in these subtle moments, seems to manifest themselves in roughly about 7 years.


Deja Vu, anyone?


**Messy Affair.**


Such a funny tale,
Epic fail,
Epic fail.


She could, when I couldn’t.
Then as fate would have it,
I could too,
I could too.


But her friends, stole her.
For the evening,
Leaving me,
Leaving me.


With a hope, restless.


**Inner Peace.**


To find inner peace, all it takes is to keep reminding yourself about it. To make it the epitome of the choices you make. To remember to not lose yourself in the past, in a train of thoughts. To remember to not lose yourself in the future, in another train of thoughts. There maybe only so much that keeps you from living in the present, and to pause before you take any action. To pause not to decide your next move, but to choose to stop instead. If ever there is anything that you would need to do, then it is only going to be something you would absolutely love to. There are no ifs, and buts, just the same as there is no better. You are no better than anyone in just the same way you are no less than anyone either. The only thing you have to remember is to not remember at all.


The secret lies in forgetting. To rid of all habit. And to look out into space, not the skies. To see what you is happening around you. And to know that it will change. To wait, and observe instead of taking action. When you focus only on the things around you, will you understand what you are here for.


**How To Not Reinvent The Wheel.**


I wish structures was an everyday thing, back in school. It gets erratically wavering between technical-informal from here on.


Last night, when we were designing a house for a particular client, we were stuck on a very simple design we had just finished detailing to the T. We were stuck on triangles. My architect wanted to rest 15' high slant walls on each other — basically building a pyramid.


Only to realise later that building all the wet areas into a pyramid of wood will trample all our plans.
So we waited. You know, for inspiration. “The last minute deadline”, as the saying goes. It did not take us long though to realise that we could make a box. After all that’s what most of us, small time architects do. It feels like an Udupi restaurant when you imagine a client walk in the office, and the design team goes,
What do you want? Big, small, medium, high-rise, long, short, wide, SMLXL. What do you want?


So we decided to go cliche. Only this time, with a twist. We decided to download files for 311 Fountainbridge, and adapt those to our specific geographic location. What I mean by that is — take a wooden house built in cold-dry-wet-whatever weather of Edinburgh, and plant the prototype in the torrential Indian monsoons. And Ah! All this, while it is pouring all over you.


Cannot be more of a jerk now, can I? Building a house in the monsoon season is not easy; granted. But it is definitely “the” most fun thing to do. (If you can survive a cold later). So we decided to give something back.
You guessed it — the ability to do so.


We added a bathroom unit to the WikiHouse. The way I see it, now all you have to do is plonk a cosy warm/cold WikiHouse bath in your space, and add all the furniture — you have been eyeing all this while — around it. Dead simple. Kinda fun.
Today when we are closer to deploying the process, we figured that using existing designs even scraps or re-sourced material helps keep the time invested — minimum, budget on the low, while giving a positive outlook as far as possibility of successful execution goes. And we found all of these characteristics in what we began with. Maybe that’s why they say,
“Everything you need is around you.”


So, stop looking. Reflect instead.


**10k Walks.**


Some miles are worth counting,
With endless silences around,
But the chatter never seems to stop,
When you find a beauty,
To ravage, and rage the crown.


**The Writer’s Manifesto.**


I think I should write.
Write on medium
Share medium on Twitter
And find a riverbank


Pull up a chair on the pebbles
A coffee table for
A small laptop
And keep typing


Not wonder a lot
About what might work out
Or what might not
Maybe carry a kindle


You know how heavy books can get
But books have a soul to them
So now I am an artist
And I want to click a photograph


Write a lot about the photograph
Not a one line caption or two
Something that might make more sense
On VSCO itself


But VSCO is more about the image
Less about the text
I want my life to be confined
To that table on those pebbles


With birdsongs floating around me
And the gushing sound of water
With only a tweet per article
And no other promotion to hoard


My life needs to be in hiding
From the world, and information flow
We are after all creators
Not consumers of the world


We add to life you see
Not steal from it, and run
So all my thoughts are limited
Limited by nature to that table


And all my dreams are realized
With every keystroke that goes unheard
This is a life too easy for me
A life where I have to do not much


A life where money is not my worry
And an escape is all that I crave for
On the earth
So I see chocolate mud


Under my grey shoes
Under a chair of rosemary wood
I wonder of all the things
Your mind can imagine


Can you feel them with the same
Tenacity, and vigour ever
But I don’t care what the world thinks of this
My small laptop keyboard is stuck


I think I should write away you see
About every living soul that I meet
And every moment when I am alive
Here.


**Kar.**


Tu kar na, khudke liye kuch kar
Chahe bhige, ye ankhiyan
Chahe rahe, bhuka tu yahan
Tu chal na, dil ke sukoon mein chal.


**Type-Faced.**


We need to get curious. About everything around us. There might be more things that we are wasting resources on than we know. I am getting into the habit of unlisting, undoing, and decluttering as usual. We need to ask more questions. I started with my phone. With all the files in it. By deleting the photographs that don’t matter, and uploading the ones that I was a bit indecisive about to the cloud. I moved on to clean my bed, and the entire airbnb again. Everything that was not being used will get picked up by the janitor at 9. There is so much that I can sell, so much that can be replaced, so much that can be ridiculed, and so much to save a day. Ideation is often interrupted with the emergence of information.


Information is a nightmare. No wonder ignorance is bliss. True isn’t it? How many times have you caught yourself on reading up on stuff you will never use? Not in the next ten years at the least. But then with the premise that Steve Job’s call about attending the calligraphy class gave us wonderful typefaces is crap. Because most people don’t get to do what they love.


And many more choose not to. If I can get through the ATM hunt ritual of any present age Indian. I will buy a notepad. No, not to scribble on it. But to illustrate the language of drawing.


It is better to carry a book because batteries die. And it is better to carry a sketchbook because not all writing is done outside the mind. We need to be out of our minds, remember? Else the information will swallow us into a bubble.
A bubble that is so clearly visible in the present day American youth. Ideas are to be jotted down, and put to work immediately. Else they lose their time, and be nothing more but listicles. Lists will give you clarity but a workflow will give you productivity. Most people forget this, and keep generating crap. Not in terms of quality, but in those of utility. Have you noticed that most of what human civilization has been upto is to create things that are not, or rather cannot be completely consumed. There is so much garbage in the utility value of everyday life. It is hard to imagine if we can ever succeed at saving ourselves. Truly, the race of man has failed. Let us hope I am wrong. We create more than what we can consume. And we give way even more to ruin. If we take a step back, and pause. We will see where we are heading.


**Po.**


Unnaku enge ponam po,
Anna yen kitte kalyanam pannam po.


**Yesterday.**


Yesterday, at about 9pm, the security said he was closing the place for the day. He said, “Light bandh karke aana, hum niche rahenge darwaze pe.” So I took an hour to pack all calls up. It was pouring. At the gates I asked him, “Ap darwaze pe hi the, itni barish mein?” We were sitting out on a porch at The Hive, there was absolutely no one there. Empty like a haunted mansion, drenched in the rains, deserted by its community, stood the mansion on its edge. As music barreled at its walls, trumpets, drums, and all. As a Navratri procession passed the gates, I waited for the rains to subside before I could make a move back home. He replied, “Humein ye kam pasand hai! In logon ko dekhna pasand hai”


**Tata.**


Sometimes I feel Sir Ratan Tata was right when he said,


“…as you grow in your organization you will find that you get lonelier, and lonelier, and your decision is eventually a lonely decision. You should what you believe is right. It maybe the tougher decision, it maybe the tougher option. But if deep inside you know that it’s the right decision for the right reasons not for the wrong reasons then you should go ahead and take it, and I would hope that you look at being ethical and holding the value systems which you want this country to have…”


**If.**


“If you’re not good enough,
you probably aren’t close enough.”


**Eternity.**


“Just for one last time, we will try to shoot at where our hearts lie, as we have run from end to end, of calendars on techno-bend, deserted as we may feel, in a decade long of ignorance, until New Year’s Eve, we shall play, or cherish these memories, for eternity.”


**Continuity.**


To help us go down memory lane, to crave a feeling of nostalgia. Even if as we speak of many memories that buildings evoke. There is nothing more than reflection to be found in those moments. It may be hard to accept as certain spaces evolve, but after all time changes, and things change with it. There are many places that most of us would go back to. To be in a time space of yesteryears, and to revolve a day or two in continuing those memories. But the fun lies not in reflection, but rather those hard, and fast stories that reality brings down on us. It watching things evolve just as a plant might take root upon the earth. There are so many such stages, that we forget about some until some happenings remind us about those in an instant. Every stage has a reason and those are the links that lead to learning in everything.


Do you know what the world needs?
A phone without the camera.


Can you lick your elbow?
You have tried that before.


How many Ferrari’s can you buy?
One. They are meant to be gifts.


Is there a toilet in the basement?
Ask Pee Provider.


Is coldplay coming to Mumbai?
We still don’t know who won those tickets.


Why do night watchmen sleep?
Because alcohol is so cheap.


Why do you need a maid?
Maybe you think you are Queen Elizabeth.


Why not disconnect?
Because the old dial-up still sings in your head.


Why don’t you make your own things?
Because you value your own time. Not human race’s.


Why do transformers have stone under them?
For massive earthing.


Coming to the point, we have all been working. On small things that require little attention. We have been on spending our time, on social media. Most of us, unaware of who our neighbours are. This has all been done and dusted. You have known about this idea for years now, if not decades.


What happens when we ignore the things we know?
Climate change.


Cedric Price might be wrong when he said, “Technology is the answer.” We, humans are guilty. Of spending time doing things that don’t matter. — Technology, social media, checking your phone, ordering food online instead of walking to a cafe where you can meet people so that people don’t crash, carrying anything but your keys, wearing a full sleeve shirt, killing mosquitoes with chemicals, watching videos instead of books, looking down at your phone, eating meals without conversations, drinking water between the meals, blah blah blah. How do you decide if something matters? Try not doing it. Instead. If we choose to weed out everything we have learnt, own or meet. We will not have decluttered, but discovered ourselves. And experience the world in a new light.


Do you know what the world needs the most?
Questions. A lot of them.


**Whistle.**


You can whistle, and so can steam, can you make a shower do that too? Today, I want to make everything open source, just because we waste resources on security. Imagine the amount of wealth, time, and thought that can be put to rest if; if only mankind gave up living, life, in a vast bubble of insecurity.


**Crowds.**


Why do the crowds cheer aloud?
If you have ever been to Times Square or Marine Drive, you will find people staring into space, groups minding their own business. No one ever bothers you with, “Hey man! What are you doing?” People seem to understand. But they are all quiet. But have you noticed that when large crowds assemble at a concert, they are screaming even if it is senseless with the mic off. It is all for one purpose — to russell.


**Shift.**


Why is there an apparent hurry in the shift for the Rupee?
With over a population of 1.2 Billion people, the news seems to be reaching people after working hours of the banks. This change which will come into effect post midnight seems suspicious. The idea of applying a change in accepted larger denominations of the Rupee will hit the poor, and the farmers of the country hard. After a week down, the atms are not yet fully operational. Why wouldn’t the government print notes in advance to ease the shift? Why wouldn’t the banks be running overnight if they had to pump the economy back to the previous normal?
For a land of villages, the shift should have been careful, and considerate of all the citizens for the world’s largest democracy.


**Meetings.**


Why am I so lost? — What drives meetings?
To be honest, last week I was not fair enough to myself, my colleagues, and my work. I slept for 12 hours a day from my otherwise 2 hour routine. That was a lot of laid back time.


Thanks to my team, the work did not suffer. But there is something that was bothering me about my body forcing me to sleep it out rather than being all “Up!, Up!, Up!”, about life. Then about two days ago I drew up a plan to push myself out of the walls of my cave. The weather was not so great that afternoon you see. I went out to meet a wedding photographer to see the potential of selling her products on our charity store. We did a half meeting [something when you know you have to rush to meet someone else, and you agree to continue it on a later date].


That same evening I lined myself up to a string of meetings. One with a random architect, one with my bestie, and one with someone I had never met before. As John Lennon quotes,
“Life is what happens to you when you are busy making other plans”.


I did only one meeting of them all. The first one. On purpose.


A deliberate choice. “Why?”, you may ask. Well I met someone. I lost myself in a conversation that made me want more of it. That made me skip dinner, convince myself it was okay being rude to everyone who was lined up. But no worries, the line up was a smart one I am sure they saw that coming when I mentioned “random architect.”


The thing here is I have slept a wink after 48 hours of being lost. That’s because I could think of nothing else to do but drool. I am up now, still half asleep with pretty interesting work meetings for the evening. What I am trying to learn is that, what was it that the wedding photographer could not crack? What made her meeting — a half meeting? What made about the next meeting made me cancel the rest of my plans?


What is it that keeps people glued?


I have never felt so “Up!, Up!, Up!”. Not even when my father showed me ways to travel all my life. It is a lot of energy waiting to be deployed. It is painful. It is distinct. It is a constant will to do something about everything. I have been deploying plans like never before. Imagine, finishing things you procrastinated about for half an year in 48 hours. There is something that still remains a mystery to me. Something I think I should find out considering the worth it has for all the people who wants to make things work. The worth of all the ideas that can crop up if only you had this particular feeling.


Honestly, I have never found something linger so indefinitely on my ever so flaky mind. I have always had a set plan when going about things. At least there is a protocol. The urgency to follow it is situational. We, lazy ass capricorns do that.


Nothing new about that. I have spent hours talking about this.


I can’t hide the fact even at my deliberate, non dramatic, quiet purposeful attempts. There was something new about that meeting. Something that kept me glued. I have written emails about this, bothered a lot of people with late night phone calls about what makes a meeting interesting? Ah! this might be something Jon Westenberg could write about. Maybe he can answer this with all that wisdom he has gathered over the years. The mystery continues.


Was it the setting? Was it the topic? Was it the weather? Was it my determination to stay out? Was it me? Maybe not.
Maybe it’s all about the people.


**Hemingway App.**


The reason I stopped using hemingway app is not because I think they do a bad job. Well that is certainly not the case.
They do an amazing job. My thought is that I write that way I think.


“Writing is after all just jotting your mind down.”


I wonder how will I shape my mind, my way, if I learn by the rules set by others. In this case, the makers of an sincerely awesome app.


**Sink.**


For mountains are built;
up from the ocean floor.


**The Best Way.**


The best way to miss a person. The best way, to capture a person. Is in a book; to capture their soul, and all memories.
Who do you miss the most? what else? Dad, what else?


There will be a time, for missing mom too; until then, Rest, until then. Today, a lot of things changed, for you, and I;, and for the world, in a sense. Let alone the past, locked itself, out of all bounds;, and an era of pain, until you ask for forgiveness.


**The Right To Share.**


The right to share. I believe this should be a fundamental right. Just like the others listed in our constitution. I know there can be more material thought to be derived from this.


Considering how much can we achieve when we share our resources, and not exchange them against each other. Ask those amongst us who have spent their university years, living in hostels or with roommates. The core belief is that sharing encourages access whereas exchange discourages access.


**Twitter X Pen.**


My issue with Twitter is that once you drop a message it becomes as impossible to find it again as to find a drop of water in the vast mighty ocean. I have often thought of not enclosing or meddling with the whole social media bubble.
Since my childhood I have noticed that the Internet as made us anew. We have gone from being result oriented peaceful societies, to loud pop culture addicts. And our actions do not hint otherwise. Not a tad bit. So whether I should pick Twitter as my final choice of an online profile should not matter to me with the force that it does. Yes, but not always. At times, help and valuable resources or valid information can be fetched from the Internet. So we need to have at the least… — hmmm actually make that, at the most, — one social media we can be involved with to stay in touch/up to date with the happenings of this planet. I know, this topic is so tiring that I did fall asleep while I pen this. But nonetheless, it was meant to provide me with me some clarity. And it did.


**Social Media Differences.**


- Facebook, Instagram is an avenue for joking with your customers, and running competitions or giveaway. It’s a place to build a “cult following.”
- Twitter, Medium is prime real estate for getting personal, and talking directly to your customers.
- G+, LinkedIn is a professional landscape, geared toward connecting businesses, and professionals with each other, and opening the door to engaging with individuals outside of your usual social circles.


**Being You.**


Life gives you exactly what you want. Have you ever noticed that ‘The Secret’ says: “Focus on what you want to happen. That’s all.” This means that if I were to focus on the kicker over, and over again, I would get exactly what I don’t want.


But there again we are all sly in our own crooked ways. Have you ever realized that ‘what you don’t want’ is also a conscious choice? Knowing this, what if we try applying this bit of information? If I choose to not want happiness, then I will have an abundance of it. So why not? Why not choose to not want happiness, and live a life of content? The catch here is that I do not mean to choose ‘unhappiness’, ‘sorrow’, ‘I just don’t want to be happy’ — I just don’t want happiness. That specific. Happiness is temporary like everything else. Feeling content has permanence. You might lose everything in the process, but then you get to be as sly as the our politicians — in ways life be surprised, — be on the list of people the universe learns her tricks from, — you will realize what really matters, and who really stays. Do you see how until November 8th, there was this fairy tale like charm to the beginnings of the world. Post November 8th, there is an attitude of facing life situations with a harsh reality, not fantasy. You will be left with a choice of being sad, and grim OR you could look at these bright side of happenings, and life-could-be-a-dream.


So then there are two sides to this coin. This might seem like the easy way, but then it is more of pretending that you don’t want something but liking it anyway when it comes to you. It is hard to keep doing this forever. You cannot lie to yourself and live with the fear that your thoughts affect your universe.


First of all, you don’t have a universe. You have a bubble. We are all too small to make a lasting impact on the universe. Even a humpback whale is too small for the vast deep ocean. So even if the universe is helping you out, my guess is because no matter how big you are, you are still that whale.


Secondly, no matter what happens or how anything makes you feel, life is just randomness at play — Just like this post and you are way better being true to yourself. Editing eats away a part of you. Be it writing, life or truth. “From a Mumbaikar’s perspective, American influence on his life just went from having a sense of Bandra to the menace of Harbour Line.”


**What’s Up With WikiHouse.**


The thought is what’s the end product or service we are offering? There are many firms in the process of building a WikiHouse, and use it for commercial purposes: competition in a commercial market. We can share our knowledge with the wikihouse project; or develop certain designs for commercial purposes; develop the model that can be scaled up or down depending on the user’s particular needs; share all our data on to the commons, and sell it off the commons on an online shop; make a WikiHouse on site for our clients; teach people to build a WikiHouse; sell components/complete design products; sell low energy additions for the WikiHouse; travel for on site assignments.
A goal here is to ease appropriation of design. An ideal way to move forward would be a book that documents all the work we have done on the project so far.


**HanX Writer.**


I have no clue about how fast I can type using this inanimate typewriter or if coding is something I should worry about as per the geekiness of being a static site web developer, and all the banter about those GitHub pages hosting issues. It can seem to be a pain to learn these things but it seems to me like a one-time thing, or maybe I shouldn’t bother so much on the layout, and search for the most minimalistic wordpress website, and add to the latest post like I am doing here. it may be weird to have no actual web presence since it will be harder for my remote team to contribute, unless I find another method for communications. I am tired of the way we are divided on multiple platforms. I want to limit my work to my mobile device, and my application usage to my webpage for all communications. Maybe there is something that lets me use my email account as a web hosting site. So that all my activities focused but not limited to one platform.


**Essentialism.**


The idea is to lose yourself in nature, and find the time to nurture your creative pursuits. Emptying the hard-drive.
Publishing all the work we have done for a decade on the website. Six is so-so. Last year I was on 20. I was dead sleepy tired on the last day of the year. So much so that I could not help but sleep all the way through my birthday, and the eve, right until 9am of January 1st. That’s me being a lot lazy. That’s 48 hours mostly at a stretch. I promised myself that I would not work another day into my 26th year. I have been bootstrapping all my ventures so far. A few things made me realise that a shift into the economic perspective of things is apparent. My team desires so, and they are correct with the effort they put into these projects. I was contacted by Prestashop about their amazing Ecommerce product. This got me thinking about using Ecommerce to fund housing. We are not keen on becoming a marketplace but the idea seems lucrative. It might help me get some maker friends do more good work. Prestashop might save us from the hassles of funding / crowdfunding / dealing with a lot of back, and forth mailers / client projects / et cetera. This idea is to pursue essentialism. Stay in our niche of WikiHouse, and develop the platform. But then again we are all creators. Ideas come, and go like the tide. It is often very hard to decide what we should not pursue. There might be a lot to process before we have a standard operating protocol. Besides all of that I love writing. Maybe a book or two shall help me present our work here to the vast outside world. Getting about 2000+ reads on Medium is quite a morale boost for someone who is in the habit of emptying his mind on every opportunity he seeks. I have been asked to write, to photograph, and to create art.


Some of us believe that these are some of the things I do well.


But then being an essentialist, and having a basic need for variety in life doesn’t always run in sync. With a lot of things popping up, and sleeplessness being the theme of the decade, I think I might as well shoot for us collaborating with others on a massive scale. It is in knowing that being self reliant when it comes to funding shall not only enable us to anticipate our options. But now because you have the money, asking questions like, “Do you want a house for free?” comes natural, and easy to deliver. Architects can have a bigger social impact that any other trade around the world. After all that’s the 101 of architecture — to use your intelligence to make this world a better place.


**I Met Someone.**


“You will meet her in seven days,
her name starts with N,
it has eight alphabets,
you will meet at the place you sang,
but hang on a sec,
don’t kiss her yet,
or you might lose her forever again.”


"Someone told me that,
nearly 10 years ago,
on an online crazy chat streak,
as crazy as this weekend was until now."


"So close to reality,
so hard to believe,
what someone saw in my past,
was my future behold! This week."


"I have never followed occult,
for all its mystery,
it has always been,
a double check for me.
She wants to be an conceptual artist,
and explore her beliefs,
in time travel, and philosophy,
while she is a soul to die for, indeed."


"When I look back on my life now,
connecting these dots seem so obvious to me,
everything fits so lovely,
even every silly thing I reaped.
Life could not have taught me better,
through sadness, and ease,
what joy was there to sit by her,
that the moment felt like eternity."


"I might sound so patronizing,
so head over heels,
being used to empty dinner tables,
and empty cafes it seems."


"I love to be outdoors,
away from those haunting patterns, and fear,
but with her this was different,
no odd design could bother me."


"I have never felt so careless,
I have never felt so free,
the design never did haunt me,
honestly."


"Mad over donuts,
and sweet chariot maybe,
have never been my options,
for dates or dining out,
lately."


"I was shivering from the cold,
so she sat me down on a bench,
and shared her love for purple,
oh baigan you see!"


"I wore that jacket to walks,
from cafes to streets,
swaggin’ around town,
while blind she be of me."


"My friends,
oh cry! they will, “the man ain’t my friend”,
for traveling to meet her,
to dine in maybe,
deny they know me."


"For such a beauty is my lady,
beyond the strokes of my pencil,
cannot capture her in sharp portraits,
or anatomy."


"Yet she echoes through my soul,
like magic in her fingertips,
like the poetry in thee,
coz’ yes, we did not kiss."


**Fill.**


And fill the air with rustic pride
Till we find another sunrise
For the silences in the night
Don’t let me fall in your dreams for life.


**Courage.**


How strange is it?
We tell all our feelings
To those who ask us out
But never to the love we seek.


**C’mon.**


Step up to the unknown, it’s beautiful insid
With beach sand flowing, into the high tide,
These moments disappear, with a frightful force,
Every cop patrolling, these sands last night,
Little to be lost, staring at the horizon behind,
Within a cloud of seamist, lies the unknown,
Beckoning my soul, to the depths of an ocean,
Cries of seagulls, and a big shoal.


C’mon, C’mon, C’mon.


**Window.**


Still waiting,
Looking at the window;
Typing.


I forgot about my coffee,
But I am waiting;
Till the coffee gets cold.


**Ashore.**


Lines from a forgotten past
Time bound memories
Of sand on the grounds
Grass, and seaweed
For breakfast on board
While a burning sun, and mist
Color yellow anoraks ashore.


**Condescending.**


All they want,
Is to be heard;
Give them a voice,
They will make you a God.


**Jaun.**


Main kahi, teri yaadon mein
Teri yaadon mein
Ro jaun.


Duur tak, jo na dikhe
Jo Na dikhe
Kho jaun.


Main kahi, teri yaadon mein
Teri yaadon mein
Ro jaun.


Jaane jo, baatein tu
Baatein tu, raaton ki
So jaun.


**Joan’s hope.**
We see, and wonder
Why does a moon shine
Under cloudy skies in furious rain
With celestial light crashing earthwards
With doors banging away
As the breeze turns into a gale
You stole my heart in a glance
And with a hangout place
You make me feel lost, and found today
Last night we had some
Rookie mistakes to wisdom for a change
Like there is more in adding to a piece
Than standing out solo instead
But of these things that I have realised yesterday
These three are the best;
You just know when you know it’s forever;
Here the past doesn’t matter;
In the end we are all just humans,
looking for an escape, a warm body,
or to shine as the moon under the cloudy skies.


**Lost.**


So lost she be,
so lost she be,
in some forest,
outside Dehradun,
I wonder when,
will she be back,
while WiFi does her,
no good.


**The Dark Knight Fantasy.**


This week I got asked a couple of times by the folks at UN, and a few other friends. A pretty simple question. And note that the mere appearance of the question does not make it simple.


“Why do you support Trump?”


I never followed his speeches. I never knew his history, and I don’t watch the news except when UN Wire requires.
Honestly I know as little about Trump as I know about your dinner last night. No clue. But I blinked. The way Malcolm Gladwell puts it. I saw a millisecond snippet of Trump somewhere, saying “He does not want war.” And to me that was enough. Everybody is at war. Americans being the best at it. Not at war games, but at making war. And when a man stands up to say that he will do exactly what his country is not known for doing right. I will stand by him.


Donald Trump has strange ways. He might be the biggest loser. For none of what will follows from today will help him win on the inside. He has angered a part of his countrymen to overpower him, even before getting to power.


While we all sit here, and wonder how comic American news gets as days pass by. He is working. He is not working on fighting other countries. That means no more conflicts, no more climate change from conflicts, and vice versa. Resources for Africans, and no more trouble for UN Wire.


“You know what he is working on? “


He is working on the inside. He is working at cleaning up. He is being a janitor. He has always been a janitor. And trust the sense of business that says,


“Those who make money are not the ones with the best product out there. Rather the ones who are willing to do what others will not. The ones who are industrious while others wish to be lazy. And the ones who charge for industry.”


Donald Trump must be Bruce Wayne, when it comes to the resources at hand. In my opinion, this chap must love Batman. Not for the glamour or the resemblance. But for those lines Commissioner Gordon said to Foley.


“No help will come from outside… A city must rise on it’s own.”


Donald scaled this thought to his whole country. Both his grandparents are German, Mother’s from Scotland. Boy oh boy! He is a trained perfectionist with all that scottish resourcefulness. And with military discipline he picked up at his army school to go along with it. He’s an introvert, and relentless. No matter what we say, he is a republican with democratic ideals, and followers. He is a nationalist, and he is working on it. Divulging every bit of thought he can scrimmage through the blunders. Every resource he can find to build his country. And that’s a rare mix of self indulgence to be found in the world.


“And I feel it is an Illinois thing…”


Does he not remind you of Robert Moses? Lee Iacocca? President Kennedy? Every time I look at Donald, he looks like those proud Americans from the 70’s. An image of those Republican funded movies, that glance right back from Lee Iacocca’s books on the automobile industry. Back then Detroit in the state of Illinois was known to be the world headquarters for likes of Henry Ford, and American Motor Companies. These are the same people who went on to build machines like the Ford Mustang. Things we cherish. And they played pride at it’s best. They made money off us. These are the same people who put money into building New York with Robert Moses.


Yes, the shitty piece of urbanism that is New York with all those clover leaf concrete patterns of road slicing the city fabric like a knife in a cake. The New York you celebrate. The New York the New Yorkers secretly hate.


“How? Self funding they call it. Just like Trump’s presidential campaign.For what reasons? National Interest, rather the nationalist’s interests.”


Lee Iacocca from Detroit said the same thing. The Ford Motor Company rivalled against Japanese car manufacturers. All of these people have had the same rivals“ — Japan, and China.”


Even for Donald. Illinois you see. Written all over it, in big black Chevrolets. That’s what they have done, will do, and never stop there. Industries that pollute our world, and ideas that make a big mess of urbanism. See my friend, all causes apart. For us the thing that holds value is the American industry minding their own business. Donald Trump is doing just that. His focus is on cleaning the mess that a long line of predecessors have left behind. Somewhat similar to what the Indian premier is upto. Maybe this is just a thing about the age we live in. Maybe the Chinese can tell you the whys, with this monkey year they figured. And in all this thoroughfare, they will forget about us, and they will rise up to their own little bubble.


“And with all pride cometh the fall.”


As history has shown us, just like Ford, Moses, and the rest of them. They shall crumble. So don’t you fret. I am support my country. And it took a lot of a time to get here.


“To believe that all work is done pre-season.”


**“Before.”**


**Tuesday, November 8, US Presidential Election 2016.**


Creativity is to be played on a mind map, not a time map. Deliberation is not the means to achieve most of what life offers. I want to publish everything I have that helps others be better at what they do. Thinking of it I might be reliving the same mistake of trying to get people to get better — to help them help themselves gets me nowhere. I should leave that to Anthony Robbins. I remember when I was learning to ride. I was kickstarting the Vespa, and then I found myself doing the whole exercise for what felt like 5 full mins. My dad said this —
“Just do it, you are thinking too much.”


It did not take half a kick to start that scooter after listening to that. I need to empty my mind. Most of this list making, and following up we do is the best example of how humans have continued to live in the past. There is some addiction to linger ourselves in that space, and analytics — Why don’t we ban the word from our vocabulary? There is no apparent reason to make a list, take a picture, for creating more physical waste to harness our nostalgia. I can take this idea to the extent that if fully applied, the planet will need no more saving. Live in the present. Use bookmarks. So that when you return to things — this means everything from actual bookmarks to the ones on your browser — you will rediscover from your past. I swear don’t you go on adding my Medium posts on your Keep for reading later. Bookmark, don’t collect. Humans have been hoarding things since times immemorial. This is you. This is your free planet. Now imagine this on a globe. If there is something you really need, you know where to find it. You need to live light. Not just travel light. Some pun clarity.


There is no point taking coconuts to Jaipur from Kerala because you think you may not find them there. You just need to look for it. I am sure Malayalees are everywhere.


Malayalees are humans. So humans are everywhere. You will find things for your survival wherever you go. Unless you are Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton. You might complain about the time, and money you have to spend on travel if you don’t carry your turtle pack. But trust me, you use the things from your dearest turtle pack because you have those things around.
Let me ask you a question. How many times have you borrowed a laptop or an iPod or an iPad or anything else that you might carry in your turtle pack from some random stranger on the street? Have you ever? Hmm… Really? So now you know, you can leave the house with just the keys, if you need to get back in. Most of the times, there will be someone to open the door, right? or if you are living alone you can hide it under the pots. Although I will not recommend pot.

If you think I am crazy, and everything else is so much important, everything else on your list is either a distraction, an addiction, or term it whatever you may — everything else is a space changer — excuses for our mind to distract ourselves. All of these things help you focus. You will not burden yourself with things you don’t need, which means Dhan Te Nan! — Room for more experiences — Te Na Nana! What did you learn from the previous sentence? When you begin something, finish it. Beginning things you really do not want to finish are half the reasons of sorrow, and anxiety in your lives. Similarly, do not finish something because you had begun them. May it be a shitty book, a bad relationship, or your bank account. I would suggest close the bank account, and try something you can manage. The focus of all life should be long term happiness. Not spending time on activity speculating or hoping that things will get better. Hope is by the way a loser’s word. Action. Not thought. Ultimately matters. I know The Secret defers — but has anyone seen The Minority Report? There is a quote that stuck in my mind from Leonardo DiCaprio’s latest production on climate change “Before The Flood.”


“The politicians sway to public opinion.”


To me, this not only means that we can now control the politicians, but also that this idea applies everywhere. If I
leave the house with only the keys, I will stop using half of my resources. That means my impact flows to consumption, oh those stupid adverts — I cannot imagine someone wakes up every morning to make the media crap on Indian television —
marketing, production, and even the raw material. Imagine the farmer lives you could save if you only carry your keys. For you, this is a conscious decision. You will have to make it.


You know why? My happiness is not betting Biryani on who will be next U.S presidential candidate with my guests. It is not talking about on how Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or gay rights or feminism or the next Flipkart Big Billion Sale matters. My happiness is simple. My happiness lies in keeping the planet alive so that your children can make better talks.


**“After.”**


**Tuesday, November 8, US Presidential Election 2016.**


My dear Americans,

While I lay here emptying my fridge because my country chose to make a economic shift,


Pondering for years maybe but an all in one night for us, Just like those surprise tests you guys love — appalled at the way your past is still trending on Twitter. It may be what you did not choose for. Knowing fully well that choosing the lesser evil is often a sad day. And please don’t weigh the opinion of 1 country against the troubles of the world. And the collective world is in the moment very real.


But there are a few things you could feel bright about:


Everything I write about here is hard, just as every thing in life is. Obama is still in power. Trump-age, and stampede is some months away. Working yourself up on social media, and the world with these juvenile antics will do no good to anyone.


Especially not yourself. Let FOX or whoever you trust spread the news. Tweeting about negative stuff spreads needless fear. Not anything else.


I don’t know how your country work, but collectively you can clean up. Call for a re-vote if you can convince the other sane side for it. Or go the french way. Just say ‘No.’ How to do that? Watch ‘Pink’ for clarity. Or learn from your own history?


“The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.” — Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.


To be honest, ignore all of that. Pause. The only thing that will matter is nothing. With the entirety of business, and life coming to a slow pace to a near halt for a few weeks because of what my Prime Minister did. But there is so much chaos here, even on normal day, that panic is not something that will ever start in India. That’s given. We know that this will pass, and so do you. So, I spent my day thinking about what is it that I really want to do all my life? And I found not one answer with a because to it. I want you to know that the things that matter the most are all inside you. — your mind, your body, everything that you cannot control. Not another. — Not another person, not another country, not another reason. Not your guns. — Not your money, not your capability, not your nothing. It is happiness, not worry. So take the time, look inside. I know it’s hard to do that in the face of harder issues.


But slow down a bit, and work on yourself. I pray you will soon see clarity like these lines, not cluttered paragraph at the beginning of this post. If you still feel bothered then imagine that you are the only person on our planet. And yes the way you imagine the planet will give you all your answers.


**Social Shifts In India.**


I am aware of the fact that with the measures taken by the Government to end black money, the commons are suffering by the lot.


**Effects.**


- Sourcing money.


This could be anybody’s everyday story, waiting on their time in a queue. Most people who would use cash regularly, have moved on to online wallet apps like MobiKwik, Paytm, FreeCharge AND PayUmoney to avoid waiting in long queues at the banks. The banks seem to have chosen to violate their terms of service to the customers by keeping 24 hours ATMs shut. Should the banks not need RBI Circulars, and a corresponding change of operating protocol notice to be issued to their customers. Whether I am legally correct or not, the banks fucked up their customer service.


- More cars.


This change has made it necessary for most citizens to start an early day to attend to queues. Small businesses that serve overseas markets will find a change of routine as the early start has shuffled wake-sleep routine. Also commuting is difficult without the availability of cash. Only commuters with a seasons ticket or a prepaid Smart Card can use the Mumbai Suburban Rail Transit System. The other options are Uber or Ola Cabs. The major effect that moving 1.2 billion from a cash heavy parallel economy to a cashless economy is documentation. 1.2 billion people have to sign up into wallet applications when the first worry on most their minds is surviving a season. Advent of wallet applications also bring many email receipts to your inboxes. With 1.2 billion people to serve on routine for such documentation, Google will need to provide for more space soon. And people might demand for free space since they have been shown a way of surviving by spending less due to the deficit of paper currency. The Kaali Peelis, and the auto rickshaws part of the transportation industry might join these taxi companies, or migrate to another kind of trade. Those who cannot afford the migration will be a good customer base for the education industry.


Vocational training, and education will have more demand to enable a smoother transition of the massive unemployment scenario that develops. As we promote intra city motorcar transit, we are polluting collectively as a society.


- Changing diets.


Most small business, restaurants do not have a pay by card system. So the choices we make in the morning have been split in two: coffee or ATM. Most of us cannot buy cigarettes because of the lack of a pay by card system. This might mean lesser sales for ITC in the coming quarters. Probably even a drop in prices of tobacco products, if they choose to not siphon the difference. Either ways, we shall experience a healthier population. Have you observed that for ordering a margherita pizza on Zomato, wallet apps offer to pay you a higher cash back percentage. Being vegetarian is a way to riches. I am unsure if this is intentional or circumstantial, but chances are that people might switch to vegetarianism for reasons of money, if not climate change. This may nullify our collective pollution.


**The Sunshine.**


“Indian services need to go online to push the currency deficit to a paperless economy. There are many benefits of doing the shift, and a need for innovation.


- Finding bigger markets.


The opportunity lies in making applications. Applications that cover our lack of infrastructure required in a cashless economy. We should learn from the ways vegetable vendors run their businesses in these tough times. An app for vendors would make life easier for everyone. Facebook will make sense in this context. To give you clarity with a set of prospective areas, think farmers, tourists, chaiwalas, tapris, auto rickshaw drivers, trains, and the rest of us who love filter coffee everyday. Think of everyone we have never met, and those of use without a bank account. These are markets right here.


- Support the tourists.


Opportunity lies in making life easier for travellers. Wallet apps in India do not let you sign up using any mobile number with a foreign country code. Wallet apps do not allow use of foreign bank accounts too. If you are a foreign national living on forex money in India, you are pretty much screwed because of the deficit. Opportunity lies in serving people stuck in these circumstances. One way is to assign an Indian SIM card, and loan money to their wallets. There lies a business idea right here.


- Save on taxes.


Wallet apps do not require you to own a bank account, this means that you can accept payments into any wallet app, and manage life better. Families, and businesses can save a lot of tax by using one bank account, and many wallet app accounts. They could pay their employees via wallet transfers.


Lesser tax filings for the employees. I agree that the government might collect lesser tax in the coming years by giving way to these apps. Looking at the situation from a broader perspective, no more paper, lesser logistical costs will lead to a smaller carbon footprint. That’s more value in it for everyone.


India has forced her citizens to go cashless. You can curse the current Government or take sides with them. But the government has done what most probably is the best thing a government can do to curb climate change. A simple change that make people conscious, and rethink about their habits, what they own, what they use, their behaviours, patterns, et cetera. With a rise in awareness for a cashless economy, the value of the Indian Rupee will soon surpass the US Dollar, the value of the Indian Rupee will equal that of time in the financial capital of India.


Today, we can all say once again that India is the best.


**Architects, And Presentations.**


Coming to think of it, presentations scare me. Architecture has given me the skill set to sell ice to the Eskimos at prices even Jobs would fear to mark up. But that’s just talk. When it comes to doing work to present your projects, and if you are an architect who wants to develop a product for yourself.


Please put a deadline before you put the price tag. I find offhand inspiration at random moments during the year, when I can get more done in a week without having to push myself, while at other times, even an year long of work does not find the same level progress. The thing that I have caught myself doing is putting green tree marks on presentation sheets.
Now I would certainly agree with you that you know ho to make those presentations look beautiful. Worth staring at! But have you ever found the amount of repetitive work that architects all over the world do creating the same styles of presentations. They rather be playing with an idea, then Photoshop their lives all along. Because sometimes focus gets lost. You waver away from developing a product to making things beautiful. If you are not careful, then you may have to start another project to back the first. If you are yet less careful, then you may as well be stuck in a cycle — starting a project to back another one — that’s more like lying to save another lie. Instead, why don’t we worry about action and getting done with things, the simplest of the idea — the basis. Why do most of us spend night after night plonking green trees on paper when we could be make ourselves more useful by doing. There is actually no need to plan a day — even today. Thinking keeps us thinking. Doing keeps us doing. Anything begets the same thing. The energies you give into the universe come back to you — magnified. What I am getting at here is that, our focus should be only on the things that we know will make an actual difference as we progress towards our goals. Yes, goals, not dreams.


Deciding — ‘decide’ means ‘to cut’ — is really a process of choosing what not to do. This is something I read in Essentialism by Greg McKeown. I have seen noticeable difference in the amount of progress I have made with my life in the past two weeks since I began to decide. Decide is a verb. Beware! Architecture needs focus. Mostly on the things that matter. To achieve it, you may have to push your norms of acceptable behaviour that you follow in routine. Every breath of it. Question everything… The time you wake up, the colour of the wall that you see, the time you take to get to the bath to wash your face, the number of apps you use, the number of times you check these apps between opening your eyes, and the visit to the bath for a face wash. Even the number of breaths you take, and so on… Question everything. It will help you look inwards, declutter your life fully, and do remember to do this every beating second of your life, find meaning about what you do/have to do — doing is not the end of things. But it is the reason most of us find the reason to live. Remember this will make all the difference.


**Not Everyone Of Us.**


There are a lot of people who walk in, and out of our lives. The best thing that you can learn from these semi-strange weird reasoning based experiences is to believe. Not in anything else but yourself. Most people will tell you that all your dreams will take a truck load of people working with you. But reality strikes differently.
Most of great work are done by solo artists, and entrepreneurs. Every one works their way out of a team, and to success. You don’t have to worry about all the thoughts running in your mind. Everyone has them.


Thoughts linger, and vanish as if they have no sense but to trip your mind by going back to them every now, and then. The idea is to focus. More on where you want to be than at where you are. External events are mere experiences that shape your thinking or add value to your exposure. And yes. Add value to your exposure. That’s what everything does. Good or bad, right or wrong, these are mere adjectives. The tipping point in life is recognizing this fact. Everything is relative, every experience is a mere bar that stands in comparison to your expectations. People come in variety, and their opinion of you does not determine your value. Those of us who work their way in teams on the side so that they can live on their individual dreams are in my opinion, playing small. We are all afraid at some point. But the idea is to believe. Not in the meaning of life, but in the meaning of your own self. We all have found ourselves in spots we cannot explain or thought we would be in. If all experiences are a reflection of your thoughts, then shouldn’t all the surprises in life be not actual surprises? This is something I have never been able to comprehend. We try to find meaning in everything. I think that is not what the point was to begin with. We need to focus on what meaning we are adding, the value we give, and the morals we stand for. Being bent by dogma or finding a reason to justify yourself is counterproductive. Blind faith might be scary, but it is what you need to progress, to keep moving forward. The uncertain belief in yourself, and your dreams with no light shining is a hard dive. Yes, it is a dive. And it is necessary. Because just as — Only in the depths of the ocean that you find all the beauty our planet holds. Only in the depths of your soul will you find the light that shines within you.


Not everyone of us are able to share a piece of our lives with complete strangers who park themselves in our living rooms. Serving people who visit Airbnb is an experience. Sachin & me have learnt a lot from such experiences. Looking back now, it seems like this might be something we would do more. Because it adds value to our country, and our people. It all began as an experiment — an idea that came about when Sachin had to move out of his hostel — We set up an Airbnb, and started working as our WikiHouseBOM Chapter there. We found that we could add more value to the concept of housing. After some months of working alone, Surabhi joined us as she helped us work out the process of Crowdfunding a WikiHouse — people sharing their home with others who pay for it — The joy of sharing. We are now graduating the concept by helping others reap the direct benefits of our efforts — #1 Crowdfunding India’s first ambisonic space dedicated for performing arts, VR, game sound design — for the community of Sound.codes. So, this is our story that will keep on growing into something better, not always bigger. I am leaving this post with a TK note so we all understand that somethings can be started without the end in sight — such as life, process, and most things of beauty in our minds. What inspires us is the fact that the most beautiful experiences in our lives — grow slowly, die a few times before they blossom, and are filled with surprises.


**Bathroom Door.**


I opened the bathroom door, wondering what will my friends think about me if they discovered that one of the sober guys was doing it too. I mean getting more, and more involved in the whole prospect of the smoke.


The other thought on my mind was, why do I always do things, say stuff, and act with the only question in my mind being: “what will they think of me?”


Well that day, when I entered the bath, the only thing on my mind was “I want to smoke three cigarettes”.
The mirror right in front of me, beckoned me to come talk to it. Do the same stuff, some power crazy, depressed maniac would does in the movies. Pep talk.


But the second thought scared the shit out of me, when I could imagine it becoming a habit, and being able to let go of the habit.


Letting Go. It brought me immediately next to my girl. Facing her, contemplating whether she might want to come back or I should give up the fight.


Some voices outside brought me snapping back to reality. I looked at the toilet window, doing the math, which part of it should I close. My actions protecting the knowledge that my friend smokes; after all, it was his bathroom, his house, his mercy. I was a nobody. I had nothing.


And for the first time in my life, I had nothing to lose as consequence of my actions. It felt sinister. It felt terrible.


With my mind busy travelling a bizarre train of thought processes, my hand was busy trying out different combinations of letting the air out through the window.


I got tired of the whole thing, and sat down on the sink, with my back to the mirror. The garden outside, still visible. The voices, still very much audible. I could see the window pane, the steel frame, green grass, the blank wall, the bright sunshine, and the things in my mind!


**Photograph.**


A photograph is like a memory. a part of the picture with a whole story unseen behind the frame. a story, of emotions, of people, of feelings. a story which only the photographer can imagine. a story which only he can narrate. a story which he alone can truly feel, truly fall for, truly be a part of. experience. one such story that comes to my mind everytime I see this photograph hanging on the wall in my uncle’s living room. It is a bunch of lillies. White, and divine like the place it belongs to. Kerala. God’s own country they say. with dark brown wood holding them, they shine. they seem to take you into the photograph so that you can imagine the scenes, the people, the identity behind the frame. you can truly go ahead, and know more about the people there.


The family was a large one but the feelings they shared, and the connection they kept, warm like the closely knit woollen fabric we know.


**A Riding Song.**


I was just riding alone;
On the way to my home.
I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.


Never did I realize;
You were riding for the sun.
If I never had cried;
In the library noon.


You would not have tried;
To keep me around.
Oh yes! I was then riding alone;
On the way to my home.


I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.
I suffered from yet another block;
Oh! This morning too soon.


Then I thought of your love;
And all it was gone.
My nose block, and fever;
Ain’t it nothing for you?


No no no, I was just riding alone;
On the way to my home.
I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.


**Once More, My Love.**


This night I shall dream of your bedazzling golden hair, and tigress-eyes.
Wrapped in echoes of your mellifluous mouth-music, I long to sip your strawberry sweet lips.
In my dreams, we fly on the exquisite winged eagle of blackness, skimming vast continents of jungles, and beaches.
The depths of all the oceans of the universe shall never separate our love.
Brilliant as white doves, the seas greet us from afar.
In the twilight we feast on chocolate-coated marshmallows, and tender laugh of hearts.
Adorned in white silk, we pluck our twirling strawberry candies from the garden trellis.
I press the forever that you wear around your neck against my eyes-muffin so that our strawberries melt into one.
You will always be my little cakes face, the wild cat of my own kissing style of love.


**Song For A Lost Cause.**


I won’t let you walk away, with a broken heart,
And I wanna ride away from the past,
I wanna kiss your tears good bye coz’ I love you.


If you need to know what I will do,
Try asking once, and it comes true,
You don’t need to cry my baby, I love you.


On a rainy, rainy, rainy, rainy, rainy,
On a rainy day you wished,
To kiss me on my lips,
And I know what you mean by it too.


We will be together for evers,
For a daughter like Chanelle, and you know,
I hope you remember them, don’t you?
Wanna roam these beaches of Goa,
With the big sun shining down on us,
I can’t take my eyes off this beautiful you.


And I’m sorry for the things I did,
Hurt ur heart, my devil;
With our love so true, I know its glue.


And I wish to pour it on you,
And stick to you,
Just the way we did every afternoons.


I am gonna be yours forever,
Even if you don’t take me dear,
I love you, you love me, & we love us two.


**Morning.**


It ain’t snow,
It’s raining;
I hope you,
Read this in the morning.


I say,
You have just 22 days to go;
So believe in carpe diem,
Carpe diem,
Carpe diem.


**Life.**


La vida es para dar besos profundos y buscar amaneceres en ciudades nuevas.


Life is to give deep kisses, and seek sunrises in new cities.


**Makerspace Quotes.**


Experience,
Sprung from pain,
to change or gain,
with a will to see,
a new awakening.


Inspiration,
Inspired making,
to see a ray shining.


Ideation,
Lost in thoughts,
or thoughtful actions,
the ideas shall come in,
slow, and swarming.


Make,
To create a piece,
on your own,
learn by making,
and other such pangs.


Prototype,
Make a piece or pick any number,
make as many as you might;
‘coz the more you fail, the closer you get,
to the one you like.


Test,
Test your piece,
and behold the joy,
that only a maker can have,
amongst humanity.


**Reh Gaya.**


Reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Ho main,
Reh gaya teri yaadon mein.


Mujhko jaane do,
Inn duaon mein.


Ho reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Barishon ki,
Barishon ki khushbuon mein.


Reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Ho main,
Reh gaya teri yaadon mein.


Mujhko jaane do,
Inn duaon mein.


Ho reh gaya teri yaadon mein,
Kho jaane do,
Kho jaane do inn nazaron mein.


**The Railroad To Tinkamentown.**


The Railroad to Tinkamentown was selected in Cityscape Article Writing Competition 2012, and published by The National Association of Students of Architecture.


Why are gutters grey, and waters blue.
The skies a hue, and the seas so true.


If I could travel, my city anew.
In trains the locals call, locals too.


I rush to the station, the hue, and cry.
To catch my train, at 8.45.


I’ll be travelling down, memory lane.
The faces in the train, say deja vu.


As the train leaves, for terminus.
I find my city, already up.


Across vashi’s bridge, and central mall.
It crosses charles’ lil island, to mankhurd stop.


The crowd now shows, its real strength.
Increasing in numbers, at every stop.


Inside the train, it’s a different story.
Everyday a new salesman, shares his story.


People line up, at the doors.
As kurla arrives, the crowd soars.


The busiest stop, on the central line.
Where every feriwala, gets down.


The few who stay, have big dreams they say.
To be a bigshot, they crave.


To the fort, they sail.
The places change, names n fame.


From vernacular n local, to what the british gave.
The crowds loses its fervour, in my train.


While the rush at terminus, leaves me dazed.
I begin, to wonder.


Where all these people, come from.
They did not, get down.


From, my train.
Everybody rushes, to their offices.


While I take, pity.
Coz I get to, make merry.


With the dark blue sky, glittering with stars.
Spread across, the 400001.


Out on the streets, looking up, and around.
You never know, what we found.


On the trip, to the hotspots.
Of my city’s, south.


Don’t notice the moon, above.
Coz all I see, is cars.


A mercedes, an audi.
And prolly a bmw, on the prowl.


I came down here, to meet a friend.
But till he is gone, I can watch, the lights dance.


And sing along, to the city’s sounds.
The pretty, queen’s necklace.


Seen shimmering, from the seas.
I see, a lil boy.


Admiring its, eternal beauty.
I pray, and, I hope.


That if, its a foreign kid.
He won’t look.


Down on us Indians.
For all the glory, that we achieved!


I dream, of my city.
As if it was built, by the gods.


My people, show.
Not a gesture, of despair.


Only true faith, in fate.
Ever since, its cradle rocked.


This city, is Mumbai.
Maximum, like a few authors called.


In spirit, and in soul.
Beating forever, alongside my heart.


**Think Of A White Shirt.**


Think of a white shirt,
Fluttering in the wind;
As the fabric jitters,
In sunny chills.


Think of a white shirt,
On deep brown soil;
With blue waters shimmering,
Under a summer sky.


Think of a white shirt,
As seagulls cry;
Echoes of human voices,
On a jetty, or a yacht!


Think of a white shirt,
Polo or not;
As crickets dot the evening,
For those binocular eyes.


Think of a white shirt,
For a silent breathe you wait;
Watch your hearts soar,
As the birds take flight.


**There.**


I had always been a kid, popular as fuck. But then I have never had a birthday celebrated by my friends. I have had times when people know it’s my birthday but they don’t wish me instead. Mom included. I spent my 18th walking the streets penniless as students are with two friends who wanted a treat. I spent my 21st in a bus back to university, having four strangers singing happy birthday to me, silently. There is a lot that I want to cry about but you give me hope, you confuse my mind with an eternal elope. I am not sure if I could ever tell you these things. But a part of me thinks that penning this down bears is all the courage that exists, within me. I have been spat on, picked on, beaten to a pulp, some dark memories lie beyond my fear. I have been asked why people don’t trust me here, maybe because I promise things too hard for friends to believe or as impossible as sincere. Thanks for sharing that the other day, I shall remember the butterfly effect as cops caught us for PDA. There is a lot of randomness running through my mind, but you give me a hope, for paradise. I am broke tonight, for the year’s ending you see. I have put all of me, in all my prophecy. Life is sad, without a doubt of joy even though we stand, and stare at blazing fast cars, and the sea. Your laughter is the reason my sadness disappears, there is more to our time than emotions, than relativity. Because every moment seems just right in the beginning, and the best that I can hope for is a constant like thee. There is a lot I have to say, say to you, and share it with glee, but I guess the night is young, I miss you, I miss your sunshine, and eternity.


**Space Is An Emotion.**


Space is an emotion, and a rather strong one. Space effects almost every aspect of a human life, not excluding what we share with each other. Every kind of space that you walk into or even crawl into at times, generate emotions that we experience in various spaces. Emotions contribute to the making of a place. Some of these factors that lead to changes in the subconscious thought. I understand that human experience is subjective. Sometimes beyond the human capacity to measure. Here, I attempt to illustrate certain observed notions between human emotions and the spaces we inhibit, mostly through my personal experience while pursuing my architectural works. The understanding of human behavior has been the key to designing event spaces or rather businesses that thrived on the concepts of people paying for their time spent at these venues. It was crucial to dissociate money from the experience.


A better way to put it would be to say that creating spaces that contributed so much more to wellness, so that most people would prioritize their lives around these spaces. My intentions for documenting are clear. To curate the intentions that I held while designing spaces in different times of my lives. To help you understand the lessons I have learnt in passing so that you may benefit from these design approaches. A human understanding of space is directly related to scale. This means that space, an empty space works differently for a dwarf, and for a giant. If you can imagine, yourself being still in any kind of a space, then you will also acknowledge to the existence of an extent of ownership that you would wish for on your surroundings. Humans consciously limit themselves when it comes to territory, even in their own imaginations. This peculiar behavior exhibited by the human mind, differs for each individual. This is what makes people unique. Ownership, not belonging.


Humans have a way of observing a lot of detail in the first experience of any kind. This is why movie scenes seem longer, dialogues come of as bolder, and space feels blurry in the first instance of experiencing. Cats have a tendency to go back the same way they entered an area. This is also true for most of us. Since the human brain is wired to play it safe (a natural evolutionary approach to survival), we do not change our paths or explore new paths around a complex, involuntarily. A new approach takes deliberate effort. This can be played for the benefit of the designer, by placing elements in a specific manner. In ways that the usual suspects will follow the same guided path to receive the intended experiences that await them. Museums use sign-ages or sentry to guide people along, into, or away from certain areas. Our aim should be to let the elements do the talking.


The human mind is always listening. The individual space can be designed based on the tastes and nature of the client. In spaces where most of us have been to, to attend any form of social gathering are shared. This is where complete privacy walks out. Sharing works differently. Sharing creates bonds. And when sharing spaces it creates shared ownership first, belonging next, and a community later. Remember, birds of the same feather flock together. It becomes essential for commercial venues to curate or contain the crowd they serve. Since these businesses are built around these communities.


They may not be buzzing with activity like your grocer’s store. But the associations you hold do effect the choices you make. Hence while designing a space, it matters. Every space needs to be built around an idea, a social group, or an individual, else they will choose to continue in their own bubble, and business will not flourish. Privacy in exchange for belonging, and vice versa. An observation in the book, “The Shock Doctrine” by Naomi Campbell shares the September 11 tragedy of the world trade center twin towers. The idea of a plane crashing into a building was so filmy that you could pass it off as a bizarre movie trailer. But when told that it is really happening puts the mind in such a state of shock that it feels the event caused awe. This emotion of awe freezes the sense of judgement and anything that you throw at such a mind, it accepts. This phenomenon can be applied to positive effect.


In most scenarios of urban scale because the crowd mentality will further blur the clarity of an individual mind. As an architect, you can lead people from shopping districts to food courts, where they feel nurtured because the mind at this point needs a break. Once they have feasted, the resting mind will need activity which can be provided in forms of events. These events are absorbed beautifully by the mind and to memory. If you give them open, public but semi private spaces of urban scales now, your user groups will ponder well enough to bring about positive realization and inspired action. Experiences are important, but how would you conceptualize them? I think of spaces as an emotion. The way you cringe when asked to walk down a narrow alley way. And the way you feel awe surge through your being when you reach an open field at the end of it. You can bet on a plant to act more of a landmark in that field, or you can inspire absolute freedom of thoughts where people can run free. A stump of the tree can bear negativity in the thoughts of this populace, because of the negativity that harbors the process that went into the creation of the stump.


So you can see that energy is passed on through spaces, by virtue of the emotions that create them. I began taking notes on people when I joined Tinder as an app. The sheer overwhelming number of new faces that I met on a regular basis led me to see patterns. As a rule, Tinder is an app made with the intention of increasing meetings and social interactions in this highly behind the screens world of ours. Human nature as a basic form governs that most human activity aims at propagation of the species. But the opportunity to understand the patterns was not ignored. So, here’s what I did. Although the app’s website has kept it’s purpose vague, there is more to what can be done with it. The idea here is to improve your own self. So as to create a better understanding of human comfort.


If you ever head out to meet a match, do not go home first. Instead, take a cab ride to any 24x7 open public space. The presence of the cab driver will ensure safety, and a decent conversation that breaks the ice. Conversations that revolve around a person’s life history do get boring once you have to tell your story to most of the people you meet. It is important to not ask the same questions other people are asking each other. Because now the conversation forces a need for new answers, a new story, and better questions. Conversations should not revolve around popular trivia. E.g., Books, music, movies, etc. This is helpful because this experience stays memorable. No one has revealed any personal information, hence privacy has been protected. Yet the need to share has not been satisfied.


What works though, are those conversations which revolve around the events of the moment. This takes real work. Most people are rarely present in the moment. They spend their time skimming through the past and the future. But meeting people to practice presence of mind to be funny, macabre, or whatever you feel you are lacking serves a purpose. The ability to create helpful information from objects, and situations, in your environment to solve problems. If you have ever been to Times Square or Marine Drive, you will find people staring into space, groups minding their own business. No one ever bothers you with, “Hey man! What are you doing?” People seem to understand. But they are all quiet. But have you noticed that when large crowds assemble at a concert, they start singing the lyrics when the artist pauses for a moment.


It is all for one purpose — to russell. “Roads have given us a lot, but they have also taken a lot from us.” — The National Geographic Documentary on Pozuzo. I heard these lines on a National Geographic Documentary when I was 9. These words have stayed with me since. Travel is often a disconnect. Most of us find it as a means to escape our routine. It is healing in sense because when the mind does not have a routine, it tries to occupy itself within the limits of time. The sudden availability of time reveals to us that there is so much more to life than what we had thought. The freedom tends to render most of our priorities as trivial. The idea of a cab is in, “3 is a crowd, but 2 is company.”


Most of us divulge from striking a conversation with the chauffeurs. This action allows us to zone out in the midst of a transit. And if we have company, then we often tend to involve ourselves in deep conversations about things that seem important or trivia to our lives. Most often, the strongest bonds between two people are formed in travel. The second strongest bonds are formed when one of them has a bad cold. For strangers, the idea of being in a cab, provides a sense of comfort and security that is a direct effect of the presence of the chauffeur. It lets people talk about things that are socially acceptable. And then when they are off the cab, it gives them context and information to build upon. Walking is a subjective experience. While for most of us, walking ensues the focused goal of getting somewhere.

That’s fast walking. But the opposite behavior of taking a stroll, has a very calming foreseeing effect to it. Some high performers, take a stroll to curate their minds with a walk. The process of taking a stroll gives us all the time and pace to jog through our thoughts. It gives a clarity to our past experiences, and lets us zone out into those to figure better reactions that we could have made to those, or in some instances, take a closer, deeper and better look at what we are up to. Walking pours in clarity to an extent where the only things that matter to us can be recognized. Walking with another person can create a bond with them. It can be a setting for providing another perspective to the matter at hand. At the same time, it can give clarity to some concepts that we hold. If done on a regular basis, walking can help us share stories and abstract specific behavior patterns, likes, dislikes of another person.


Walking in a group of three is often brisk paced than the other two instances. The joy of such a walk is in the quick sharing of information that comes with the process. Because the time share is now split into 3 parcels, everyone is more aware about the thoughts they run. This consciousness brings to them a heightened filtering of the clutter. The process then brings clarity to the most personal thoughts and spill out the rest.


**Urban Trekking.**


I commute a decent 2 to 3 hours one way on my urban trekking rounds for site visits around the city. There is this thing about travel. It is probably the only thing that dissolves time. The very image of a day is a blur, and you cannot help but see that the dates, and days fade away. The only thing that remains in memory are the songs in your ears, the expressions of people you have met, and the waiting you have done along the way. It is hard to arrange memory to a chronological order. Everything gets a place of its own. Standalone. And in this abyss of separation, you see what truly matters.


What led to the next best thing, and what are the habits that you can give away. Almost everything we do in today’s world is unnecessary. Almost everything is built upon the pressures of peer mentality. And it’s hard to see how much of your free will is influenced until you separate yourself physically, and literally from that crowd. It is in this third person self image can you see all the flaws of the modern day society. The habits, the attitudes; the manners, the attributes. The behaviours, variety of self beliefs, and the everlasting self doubt that comes from such a biased free will. It is the long road home that helps us see how much of bullshit we have been putting up with. The small unnecessary details that were until now seemingly essential. Once you know what they are, then you have choice.


With this choice you can choose to harm or grow yourself. With this choice comes self awareness. With this choice comes ownership. And this is the key to saving resources. Every form of resource. And these choices when adhered to, create a never ending spiral of habits that create infinite growth.


**A Study In Scarlet.**


Of expressing our emotions, and journaling innately inappropriate desires, in words and images, to know for myself, the exact nature of my being. So that I can edit myself, and make a version of me, through the process of constant trial and error, until I am certain about what I am.


**2000 Dates.**


So, I have been on 2000 first dates over the last 5 years. The experience has let me see the alarmingly range of people who are swept away their choices under a lull of popular beliefs. The things that people do, including the way they treat others under a belief of self preservation or self interest mostly has led to believe that nothing is true, it’s all a sham, and no one loves you or anything for anything at all.


The moment you give someone what they ask for, they will feel happy for that endorphins hit, and they will toss you like a used condom and even talk trash about you to their friends. They will do this, even if you have literally saved their lives when they asked you to.


**Portraits.**


So I have always been thinking about making a blog for the way my hair grows back. Self shot portraits, day after day, documenting how my look changes to an extent that I get stopped at ID checks because the photo doesn’t look anything like me. I have had my doubts on how the world would take it. The judgements passed, and why am I doing this. As if my inner self criticized me for validation of some sort. But then again the whole process shall free me of my qualms and queries. It will make me free as I throw an vulnerable side of me into debate on purpose. The swarm of people that I come into contact with on social media, and then that knowledge being a reminder that public opinion does not matter. Fit me as I am. Take me as I am. For I have years of experience walking into difficult situations knowingly. The idea that I have to prove something will vanish. And I will be freed of all self doubt that sets in when I am questioned for my radical uncommon actions, or behaviours. The self awareness that this brings is more important as an asset to have than any other life experience can bring. This blog is @madewithadobe.


**Bumble.**


Well I matched with a girl on @bumble. She asked me out for the marine drive date. It was her idea entirely. So I went. This was a dating app date. Which she refused to call as a date. I met her for the first time. It was her first date on bumble. Second day on the app. In the middle of the night, she said she was sleepy, I am booking a cab back home.
She said she is feeling dizzy. So I offered her water. Then she said she won’t drink water. Then she said she doesn’t like walking. Then she said she wants to go use a washroom. So I took her to Intercontinental to use their restaurant rest room. Then on the way there she said she is on her second day of her periods. Which I honestly don’t know whether to believe or not. Her argument was that she was uncomfortable because of the periods. So it was right on her part to leave midway.


Which is okay I guess. But planning an all nighter during your periods is a no go na. So I agreed when she said she wants to book a cab and leave for home. So I was left with nothing to do but wait it out at marine drive for 5 hours. So I hitched a ride in her cab to Andheri because I knew I would get smokes and tea there. I bought smokes. I had a cup of tea and the cops drove this cyclewala away. I hate such women. When they quit on their own plans after its made clear that something like this will leave me stuck in the middle of the night. Half of me is angry on myself for taking a chance on someone planning an all nighter at marine drive again.


I will probably never take a chance on anyone again. That night was so Deja Vu. I wish I had a better judgement of people after all the people I have met. I am now going to run my red flags for people without any leniency. I will probably sell my books on Instagram.


**Distances.**


So I have been traveling back and forth cities now. The one thing that I have realised in process is that our perspective about distances change when we travel. For example, a distance between Bombay and Pune of about 122kms in 2.5 hours used to feel like a lot. But yesterday it felt like a place next door. Maybe that’s what globetrotting does to you. Our take on life changes in direct proportion to the experiences that you expose yourself to. Travel makes superficial everything that would be deemed important that a person who hasn’t travelled often would deem important. Life seems larger than what worries you everyday. Routine seems to blind us to the vast world that lies beyond it. It is funny how millions of us would choose to scurry into routines that seem dull to those who put themselves in situations that are reckless, dangerous, but alive.


**Rebounding.**


I think that all of humanity is now hit by an epidemic. An epidemic of insomnia. From the constant access to technology, and the endless need for attention has brought us all to our knees, as we search for constant validation. The race of men seemed to have forgotten the art of sticking to things. People change relationship statuses faster than they try out clothes in a lonesome changing room. Everybody has a list of impulsive needs which they will swear to come as naturally to them as butterflies know of caterpillars. But the only problem here is that no caterpillar has ever known that it’s future holds being a butterfly. So people climb from leaf to leaf, in search of something greener, forever changing and growing, and never holding any memory of what they promised themselves on the last leaf. In the end, we will all find ourselves lying a vast wasteland of half eaten leaves, empty inside, and still hungry for more, unsatisfied. That’s the trap that you will soon find yourself in, if you do not learn to stop, pause, reflect, and standstill even when the going gets tough.


The only thing that can save you in this mess of constant rebounding off people is same as the common idea of growth, career, money, or life, or otherwise anything. The idea is to pick one thing, or person, and to stick to it, or him/her.


**Tu Chal.**


Tu khud ki khoj mein nikal Tu kis liye hataash hai Tu chal, tere wajood ki Samay ko bhi talaash hai Samay ko bhi talaash hai


Jo tujh se lipti bediyaan Samajh na in ko wastra tu (x2) Ye bediyaan pighaal ke Bana le inko shastra tu Bana le inko shastra tu


Charitra jab pavitra hai Toh kyun hai ye dasha teri (x2) Ye paapiyon ko haq nahi Ki lein pareeksha teri Ki lein pareeksha teri


Jala ke bhasm kar use Jo kroorta ka jaal hai (x2) Tu aarti ki lau nahi Tu krodh ki mashaal hai Tu krodh ki mashaal hai


Chunar uda ke dhwaj bana Gagan bhi kapkapaega (x2) Agar teri chunar giri Toh ek bhukamp aayega Ek bhukamp aayega


Tu khud ki khoj mein nikal Tu kis liye hataash hai Tu chal, tere wajood ki Samay ko bhi talaash hai Samay ko bhi talaash hai

**Listening.**


Whatever might be the reason that stops you from doing what you want, it is essential to recognize that the only way you can get things going is by trusting yourself blindly. The most common mistake that we do as humans is to ignore our inner voice, that inkling of a notion that beckons us against something or for something. That inner voice is always correct. It is always the quietest. It is more true than anything that surrounds it. The key to making better decisions is to de-cide. To cut away everything that you don’t need. And the easiest way to find what you don’t need is to ask a single question.


- “Do I need this?”
- And a simpler rule.
- If the answer is not a clear “Yes!”, then it is a clear “No.”


**The End.**
