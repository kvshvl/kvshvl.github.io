Infinity Mirror Installation for Adidas.

Client: ADIDAS, Homegrown, Maker’s Asylum.  
This installation was inspired by <a href="https://hirshhorn.si.edu/kusama/infinity-rooms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infinity Mirrored Room By Yayoi Kusama</a>. 
In collaboration with Homegrown magazine, and Maker’s Asylum, I built an <a href="https://www.makersasylum.com/projects/adidas-installation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infinity Mirror Installation</a> for Adidas’s new product launch. The product launch event took place at Todi Mill Social in Mathurdas Mill Compound, Lower Parel, Mumbai.
