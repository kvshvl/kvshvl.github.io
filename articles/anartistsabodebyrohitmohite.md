**An artist's abode by Rohit Mohite**.

It is rare to find a project where the clients have supreme clarity about what they want. This sort of clarity often rises from knowing what you don't want. The client is an artist. This provided us with a great opportunity to explore various ideas. She is clear that her desired language - which in this case - was Scandinavian style of home decor with a minimalistic approach to interiors.

She played a major role in this process. We gave her a house, and she made it a home. We thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.
