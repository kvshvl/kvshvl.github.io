**Slowly letters 4**.

Thanks for writing your name. Most people here do not write their names on these letters. It will help if we run into each other someday. :) 

I am currently in between jobs. I am still weighing my options career-wise. I write a lot these days for my newsletter and website.

A bit more about Bangalore. This project is about creating and publishing 5 architecture books that should sell 5,000 copies at Rs.200 each in an year. This is not an easy task. If successful, I will get paid 2,500,000 by the research firm that wants to employ me.

Problems are that,
1. They are willing to spare 10,000 a month for my retainer.
2. They want to invest 6 months of time in the making of these books. This might not be sufficient to get it done.

The benefits are,
1. I *may* get 2,500,000 after 6 to 12 months.
2. a. I can build network of subscribers for my written content/ newsletter.
3. b. I can build awareness that I curate portfolios and make an entire social media strategy as a service.

The alternative steps are,
1. Finishing Revit architecture certification from AutoDesk.
2. Getting a job at an architecture office in Mumbai for 35k to 40k a month steady income.

Damage control options are,
1. Using Bangalore's retainer to get Revit architecture certification from AutoDesk by February.
2. a. Returning to Mumbai and following alternative step 2.
3. b. Using benefits 2. a to host interested folks at a farmhouse on Airbnb. I could also do architecture competitions with the money I can make on Airbnb. This will then be a full-fledged practice.

In conclusion fail safe paths are,
1. Damage control 1. & 2.a.
2. Alternative steps.

Enough about my dreams, and work!

Well enough about me.
You are trying something new. That's interesting enough. :)
