**Can you?**

Can you catch up tonight? or my imagination, is gonna burn my memory. Can we sit by the drive? or a soothing temptation, is gonna rape my melody. Can I see you in a different light? or my poetic expression, is gonna lose all theory. Can’t the world say goodbye? ‘coz in you my heart, has found my everything.
