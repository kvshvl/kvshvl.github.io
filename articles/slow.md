**Slow**.

So there is this entire idea of slow. Oftentimes we comes across a point in life while making a broth that it turns out to be better if we just let it simmer, and boil up with time. Without a rush, or a haphazard frenzy to make something out of it. I feel that the secret ingredient to everything is time. We more often than not, forget about it. We rush to get things delivered. We rush to deliver things. We expect so much of ourselves, and others that we forget. We forget to live. We forget to enjoy the moment.

We forget to experience what the moment has to offer. We forget that no matter if itâ€™s pain, and suffering, or joy, and peace. None of it will be served to us in the exact same way by life. So we might as well experience it while it lasts. We forget to feel. We forget how if you leave it be, and wait, then most things become so much better. This is true of love interests, passion projects, businesses, and even making Maggi noodles. Some things end, some last. The focus here is in not being lost in thought. The focus is to experience the moment, consciously.

- *Slow things down, and everything becomes more beautiful.*
