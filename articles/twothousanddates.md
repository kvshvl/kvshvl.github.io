**2000 dates**.

So, I have been on 2000 first dates over the last 5 years. The experience has let me see the alarmingly range of people who are swept away their choices under a lull of popular beliefs. The things that people do, including the way they treat others under a belief of self preservation or self interest mostly has led to believe that nothing is true, itâ€™s all a sham, and no one loves you or anything for anything at all.

The moment you give someone what they ask for, they will feel happy for that endorphins hit, and they will toss you like a used condom and even talk trash about you to their friends. They will do this, even if you have literally saved their lives when they asked you to.
