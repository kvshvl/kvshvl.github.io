**Shower**.

I dare you, to notice detail. Right from when the first drop of water that hits your face when you wake up in the morning. The feeling that it evokes on your skin, and if you can try, all the way into your tissue. The amount of focus this requires. For you to slow down your time, and observe, to see, to feel, to understand, to discover. The way every drop of water splashes around it’s own body, and make. The reflection of light, and the mirror image of the faucet. To know, and understand that there is beauty in all things. That the most beautiful things are those that often go unnoticed. With every passing sound, when even silence is a sound, can you hear your mind’s quiet?

Feel the white ceramic as it clears your mind as porcelain, until you are left with nothing but that one thing you cannot undo, you cannot forget, you cannot ignore or you don’t want to quit. That my friend is your calling. The only thing that makes every seed of pain redundant. The mere thought of which gives you a joy to die for. And yes. Life is about joy. Not emotions, not sorrows, not thing like shopping what you don’t need. Joy is deeper than happiness. It is what you feel when the music flows from your pores, not from your larynx at bathroom singing. Where you actually see time freeze, while you make circles around your universe or anything that you can imagine.
