**Slowly letters 8**.

Is this your real name?

Well, I love writing long letters. :P 
Yes, I did move around because my parents moved around for very specific reasons. I moved around in search of greener pastures, or for someone, I was dating then. Mostly for projects.

To move around, well the fascination lies in making the journey. The newness of it all is exciting. I have never got tired of moving around. You should try it too. :)

Wow. is IT in Chennai a common thing? Do you write code too? Or are you a tester? I have a profile on GitHub. But I made that to code my website on GitHub Pages. Nothing fancy.

Do you have pet/s? I read your bio. I would like to know more about what you think of photography. Do you share? VSCO? Instagram? EyeEm? 500px? or are you a photographer who does not share your clicks?

Wow. I have been to Mysore thrice in my life, and Chennai once. I always wanted to spend more time in Chennai, but the weather is too hot than what I can take. Where did you learn Telugu? I love learning new languages. I used to go on online chatrooms, sign in to a room of any place in the world, say Sarajevo. I would ask if anyone in the room knew English. If I was lucky to find someone, I would ask this person to "translate: How are you?" in their local tongue. I would pick up translations for phrases like this. After my tutor went offline, I would chat in the local language. I would make note of any unknown phrases to run by my tutor later in time. This process is damn helpful. It is kind of taxing to maintain a journal of all the phrases but you can make two columns in a page, and write down English | Local Language to keep track of things.

Happy New Year to you!
I don't do new year resolutions. Instead I keep working on whatever it is that I am working on in the last week/ first week of these years. I aim to move out of my mom's house. I want to go to Bangalore to help a friend out. I want to get a sustainable secure job. I want to start traveling the world. Maybe moving abroad. Also, my birthday is on the 31st of Dec. When is yours?

Question for today: How many friends do you have? Please do elaborate on the positives of these people.

Yours truly,
