**Timepass**.

Interestingly the only thing that I assume eats into my time is doing timepass. Timepass not because I don't know where I am supposed to go or what I am supposed to do but because I like to be lazy at times and then I procrastinate and then it keeps building into this bubble of a snowball. And I end up losing a lot of time because I keep thinking. But if only I can stop thinking and start doing I think I will be better off at achieving my goals. It does not take more than a minute for a task. Also if you look at it and if you count the number of things that you are able to do in a day's time, right from brushing your teeth, to washing your ass, to sending that email, to completing a major project, you will see that if you really sit down to finish something then you will achieve it in less than 20 minutes.
