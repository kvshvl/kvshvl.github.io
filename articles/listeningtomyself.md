**Listening to myself**.

You know this is an additive process because I have been spending so many minutes on Instagram and other platforms on resuming content and it is pretty addicted to stay on those platforms because well that's how they are designed right. Now considering that I am speaking into the microphone and I am going to get paid for this voice over thing which is basically what you are eating at the moment there is nothing more satisfying than knowing that somebody out there will learn from you and from your mistakes and from your life experiences and will at to their own life all the good things that you have learnt in your life. So listening to me is not addictive enough for me but the knowledge of understanding that I can now make a difference by sharing ideas with the world is something that truly satisfies me as a person and I don't think I will ever stop posting using speech to text on Typewrighter.
