**3:10 to Yuma**.

I am now going to jot a film because most of my tinder dates have succeeded in disappointing me by showing an uncanny ability at flipping. 

Have you seen 3:10 to Yuma? 

That movie shows a protagonist do things even when he need not have to because he wanted to set an example for his son. And the antagonist willingly martyrs his companions to support the protagonist’s cause. These are the true stories that built a country like America. We should learn from it. And if you think it’s ancient, take Elon Musk for an example: that man says;

“When something is important enough
You do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”

I think it is not his quote because my primary teacher told me the same exact thing. My point being, my city needs a lesson on commitment. So far, as an architect, I am wholeheartedly disappointed in mankind, and angry at everything around me. I think this world needs to be committed like the protagonists of 3:10 to Yuma.
