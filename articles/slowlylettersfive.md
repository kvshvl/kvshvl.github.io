**Slowly letters 5**.

My mom's family is from Telishery, Kannur.
Dad's a Maharashtrian.

Assistant Professor sounds so cool :P
I have a keen interest in psychology but never got the chance to read a lot about it.
Congrats on the job :)
M.Phil and Ph.D. and then what's next?

I am currently job hunting, waiting for a legal process for my inheritance to get done.

Well you have done your masters :P I haven't yet. I need to do a lot of catching up to do with adulting. I did most of the things simultaneously. This happened because I help other people solve their problems, and as a result involve myself in a hoard of things.

Well I stopped deportation of a French national who was a guest at my Airbnb. It's a long story about how NMIMS's exchange program staff did not get the right stamps on his VISA and tried to send him back under the premise of proving his residency in this country as invalid. I will tell you that in person, on call, or maybe somewhere we can talk. Soon enough.

I am probably going to stay put in one place for a while, and then travel for 5 years in a row. I haven't really been to popular places like Gokarna, or Goa alone. But I visit different cities all by myself and usually have a group of friends joining me.

Saudi Arabia is a tough place na.
I so want to visit Kochi Muziris Biennale next year.
What's your hometown in Kerala?
I was in Bangalore, from 2017 Septemeber to 2018 June.
Do you like Delhi? I have never got a chance to move to that city.

I watch Tamil and Malayalam movies. I like Tamil songs. Which songs do you like? I wanted to learn French only because it is compulsory if you want to move to France. 

I think USA is not a good option. Bad place to be rather.
Canada is amazing, but only if someone comes along with me :P
Maybe we can travel together then.

Why are you worried about life? 
Isn't it better to make a list of things you want, and go for it?
You can always improvise your plans if you fail?

Well it's ok na. You have a masters degree.
I am sure if you try again, you will clear it.
Besides you already know a lot about clinical psychology.
Why not do an M.Phil in a related subject, and then do your Ph.D. in clinical psychology? 

I was not aware that we don't have an All India Entrance Exam.
You must have travelled a fuckloads for these exam, and interview rounds?
Where all have you been?

3 years old is so young! I am sure you have an amazing mind too!
Oh! So how many siblings do you have?

My oldest memory is probably around when I was 4. I was in the living room look inside the room. There was a sofa in front of me with a window beyond it. My mom was standing at the window looking outside, waiting for Dad to come home from Mauritius. I remember asking her, "What is Kushal? Since everyone calls me Kushal, what is Kushal for me?" (Answer is "Name") I think I spent about 15 mins getting my point across with whatever limited vocabulary I had.

Today's question: What inspired you to do psychology?

Have a nice day.
