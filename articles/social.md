There was this one who found an answer to everything that I found lying deep inside cracked under the sun from an ancient shrine to an abyss divine. I thought so much for the future that lie, and a past that haunts tremendous baggages to hide, to let go with wonder, to find joy, with a vacay around the bay; tonight. I wish I could write better poems for now the city drinks itself to false joy in gulps of alcohol, and marijuana lit; there must be someone who goes beyond all wits, someone who can see, and holds to the hilt; those rules they made as in Sun Tzu’s times. Often we meet such random souls but that’s not our true self or a distant goal all of us crave for attention so much more that we crash into actions and people that are gore. Only to find that alcohol does not, does not find us joy, only hangovers for a moon, for when a new sun arises, and lets us know; there is so much more to life, and life in store that we might just drop the idea of drinking, and find our joys not in people, but ideas for sure.
