**What is thinking versus writing?**

So thinking is a process that you do with your own mind and then you forget about it maybe or maybe do something about it. Whereas writing is a process that you do within your own mind but you take it down on paper. When you take it down on paper your mind is already jumping at different ideas or different processes or different imagined perspectives. There is a battle that is going on inside your mind about making the right choice of words. It is hard for me as a writer or as an architect to keep these two things apart. Although I have been advised by a lot of people to not think and dump my mind onto paper I think it is almost impossible for me to do so. They have also advised that meditation will come handy if I want to achieve this kind of a mental state. But I don't want to meditate. I don't want to sit down and put my mind at rest because when I do so I will be coming my own imaginative natural self. I will also be killing my own creativity.
