**Alone**.

Thank you for the inspiration. It is things like these that make me keep on going even when all the odds are against me, and the future of all my dreams seem bleak. On days when every motion you made seemed to have hit a dead block. These words you write make every moment worth reliving. Honestly, I haven’t read all of your post but the words I picked on when I scrolled down until here gave me enough to wake up from the middle of my sleep, and drag my mind into a pool of wretched commitment.

And I mean no disrespect. All I can say is “You should write more.” It keeps guys like me going. As we feel direct influence, the people of our planet will soon see an impact of your work. Thank you a lot for pulling me out of timid safety.
