**Death**.

So here’s what happens when you die
You close your eyes,
and you see it coming
You imagine all the ways within that moment
Of how you can die.

You might be lucky enough
If you are stationary
As in in your bed, and not
Prowling on the streets /outside.

For then there is no action
Or reaction
To concur
That might cause your demise.

If you are lucky
You might see
The exact way
Held in time.

But there is a thing
About the future
It changes
Every time you look at it…

Because
You looked at it
So that’s why
Then you won’t die.

And you know you have won a victory
As temporary as it might be
A victory over death
For this thing happens to thee.

There is one nice little pain in your fingers
Almost like something is pinching inside
But with more nerve sort of feeling
Not an external desire.

That pain makes you want to be alone
Curl like a prawn, and feel your body inside
It makes you want; to be lost in your own thoughts
But then it subsides.

Whenever you have to die
A finger will pain
From that point
Near your palm.

Usually it’s your left arm
For most of your arteries,
And veins there
Go straight to the heart.

And it will wake you up
If you are not destined to die
Or if you have seen the future
Then it changes for you that’s why.
