**Passion**.

It feels almost like I have lost the passion to do something for others. As if everytime I think of solving a problem for creating a product or just sharing information and knowledge that might help someone achieve something in ways unforeseen, I get lazy, hopeless, and lost. I don't know why I have been feeling this way lately but it maybe because I have tried too hard in the past to make the world a better place. Everything I have tried has not worked out, well not everything most of the things. And it is getting harder by the day to be able to find something that brings me joy even by the thought of it.

I would want to be excited because my work is rewarding. Nothing else matters except doing what makes me feel alive.
