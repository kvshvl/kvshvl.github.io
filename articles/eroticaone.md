**Erotica 1**.

I dreamt of us. You met me at a cafe, you winked at me, and bite your lips, held my hand, and we ran into a closet.

In your office, behind the pantry, on conference tables, you sit. While I lean in to kiss you softly, you spread your legs. I hover my palms on your skin, neither touching or pressing, but only a slight presence that leaves you wanting, for more.

As I feel the warmth of your thighs build up with your moans, you run your fingers through my hair, holding my face as we kiss, guiding my head down, over your chocolate hills, into a flowing valley, and holding me there.

And I tease you with my beard tickling your panties. With my hands on your nipple, circling it slowly, and with patience. I wait until your moans grow so loud that everyone else in the office knows that you could not wait until day's end. Then I slid your wet panties off you, and let your skin feel my beard. As you force me to eat you.

I hold back restraining. To kiss your clit first, then nibble. So when you tell me, "Fuck baby! Eat me", I can swallow your pussy whole with my tongue on you. Going deeper every second. As slowly as we can, feeling every inch of progress I make. With my mouth full of your cum, and my saliva dripping right back on your clit. I release it drop by drop, tantalizing your labia in return.

A finger running slow, and deep. Making you believe that time is your enemy with all the pleasure that it brings you, and all the pain that you inflict on me. With your long nails, running all over my back. I howl in pain. To moan together in pleasure, we can't wait for you to dominate me, and then I will throw you on a bed and have you alone.
