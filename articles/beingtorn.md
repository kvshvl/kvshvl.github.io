**Being torn**.

Between a job or your own shop,
Between money or that desire to hop,
Even if it means that you might pretty much flop,
Between being debt free, and poverty a top,
Between a cage, and freedom of thoughts,
Between what Jim Carrey said about his father,
And what mom screams to you a lot,
Between security, and your dreams of years,
I am lost at making a decision dear,
Between selling my craft, and saving my soul,
Between things that might last, and a risky endeavour.
