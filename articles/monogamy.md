**Monogamy**.

Case 1: Monogamy is a pattern.

I am scared of people who say monogamy since July. Like they say they want monogamy, and want to make an effort to work things out. Then they call every five hours and talk for three hours everyday. They say they are okay with the grocery shopping, and cooking dinner together for the first date. They say that we should take care to not fuck on the first date, even if we are at home for dinner, and we cuddle later.

Then they will ask to fuck when we are cuddling, and that's okay. But here's the catch.
1-a. If I fuck them they will enjoy it, and ask for more sex in the same night.
1-b. But in the morning, they will say that they don't feel like working it out because they did not feel a connection *since the beginning*.

OR 

2-a. If I say that we agreed that we should take care to not fuck on the first date, then from that moment onwards they will literally push me away physically by placing their knee between us, and say that let's just go to sleep.
2-b. They will break all ties in the morning, and  they will say that they don't feel like working it out because they did not feel a connection *since the beginning*.

Conclusion: I am puzzled because if you did not feel anything since the beginning then why would you call me so much! 

Case 2: People flipping is a pattern.

This starts with Day 1, a woman telling me that she is as serious as 'she is looking to start a family'. Then she tells me on the weekend that she only want to fuck me. Then she shares explicit pictures a day later. Then she tells me a day later that she was only being horny from Day 1. Then she ghosts me a day later.

Then she disappears for 2 days. Then she returns to tell me a day later that she doesn't like me at all and we could be friends. Then she tells me a day later that she has enough friends, sure I have too, so we can only be acquaintances. Then she tells me a day later that she is unsure of when we will talk next because she talks to her friends once in a week.

Conclusion: I am puzzled about why would someone go from they want to start a family to ghosting me abruptly.
