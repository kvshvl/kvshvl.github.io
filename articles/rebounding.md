**Rebounding**.

I think that all of humanity is now hit by an epidemic. An epidemic of insomnia. From the constant access to technology, and the endless need for attention has brought us all to our knees, as we search for constant validation. The race of men seemed to have forgotten the art of sticking to things. People change relationship statuses faster than they try out clothes in a lonesome changing room. Everybody has a list of impulsive needs which they will swear to come as naturally to them as butterflies know of caterpillars.

But the only problem here is that no caterpillar has ever known that it’s future holds being a butterfly. So people climb from leaf to leaf, in search of something greener, forever changing and growing, and never holding any memory of what they promised themselves on the last leaf. In the end, we will all find ourselves lying a vast wasteland of half eaten leaves, empty inside, and still hungry for more, unsatisfied. That’s the trap that you will soon find yourself in, if you do not learn to stop, pause, reflect, and standstill even when the going gets tough. The only thing that can save you in this mess of constant rebounding off people is same as the common idea of growth, career, money, or life, or otherwise anything.

The idea is to pick one thing, or person, and to stick to it, or him/her.
