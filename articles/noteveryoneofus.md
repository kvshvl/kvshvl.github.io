**Not everyone of us**.

There are a lot of people who walk in, and out of our lives. The best thing that you can learn from these semi-strange weird reasoning based experiences is to believe. Not in anything else but yourself. Most people will tell you that all your dreams will take a truck load of people working with you. But reality strikes differently.

Most of great work are done by solo artists, and entrepreneurs. Every one works their way out of a team, and to success. You don’t have to worry about all the thoughts running in your mind. Everyone has them. Thoughts linger, and vanish as if they have no sense but to trip your mind by going back to them every now, and then.

The idea is to focus. More on where you want to be than at where you are. External events are mere experiences that shape your thinking or add value to your exposure. And yes. Add value to your exposure.

That’s what everything does. Good or bad, right or wrong, these are mere adjectives. The tipping point in life is recognizing this fact. Everything is relative, every experience is a mere bar that stands in comparison to your expectations. People come in variety, and their opinion of you does not determine your value.

Those of us who work their way in teams on the side so that they can live on their individual dreams are in my opinion, playing small. We are all afraid at some point. But the idea is to believe. Not in the meaning of life, but in the meaning of your own self. We all have found ourselves in spots we cannot explain or thought we would be in.

If all experiences are a reflection of your thoughts, then shouldn’t all the surprises in life be not actual surprises? This is something I have never been able to comprehend. We try to find meaning in everything. I think that is not what the point was to begin with. We need to focus on what meaning we are adding, the value we give, and the morals we stand for.

Being bent by dogma or finding a reason to justify yourself is counterproductive. Blind faith might be scary, but it is what you need to progress, to keep moving forward. The uncertain belief in yourself, and your dreams with no light shining is a hard dive. Yes, it is a dive. And it is necessary.

Because just as — Only in the depths of the ocean that you find all the beauty our planet holds. Only in the depths of your soul will you find the light that shines within you. Not everyone of us are able to share a piece of our lives with complete strangers who park themselves in our living rooms. Serving people who visit Airbnb is an experience. Sachin & me have learnt a lot from such experiences.

Looking back now, it seems like this might be something we would do more. Because it adds value to our country, and our people. It all began as an experiment — an idea that came about when Sachin had to move out of his hostel — We set up an Airbnb, and started working as our WikiHouseBOM Chapter there. We found that we could add more value to the concept of housing. After some months of working alone, Surabhi joined us as she helped us work out the process of Crowdfunding a WikiHouse — people sharing their home with others who pay for it — The joy of sharing.

We are now graduating the concept by helping others reap the direct benefits of our efforts — #1 Crowdfunding India’s first ambisonic space dedicated for performing arts, VR, game sound design — for the community of Sound.codes. So, this is our story that will keep on growing into something better, not always bigger. I am leaving this post with a TK note so we all understand that somethings can be started without the end in sight — such as life, process, and most things of beauty in our minds. What inspires us is the fact that the most beautiful experiences in our lives — grow slowly, die a few times before they blossom, and are filled with surprises.
