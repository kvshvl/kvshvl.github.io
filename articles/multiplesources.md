Do you know what the key to wealth is?

So the sooner you learn this the better it is. That's supposed to be the ending of the previous article. The sooner you learn that the better it is. if you look at what you can achieve using money or rather if you can figure out what you want to achieve using money that is where your calling lies. the trick is not to figure out how much money you want that request to figure out where you want to spend it.

have you ever observed that all the people in the world who keeps pending so much of the wealth in buying things in shopping in eating lot of good food and in travelling. These people they never seem to have a lack of money. They always seem to keep getting more. This seems like a law of nature to me. It is pretty interesting how things work no?

so again the trick to having lasting wealth is to spend it in the right places. Not saving, spending.
