**Bumble**.

Well I matched with a girl on @bumble. She asked me out for the marine drive date. It was her idea entirely. So I went. This was a dating app date. Which she refused to call as a date. I met her for the first time. It was her first date on bumble. Second day on the app. In the middle of the night, she said she was sleepy, I am booking a cab back home.

She said she is feeling dizzy. So I offered her water. Then she said she won’t drink water. Then she said she doesn’t like walking. Then she said she wants to go use a washroom. So I took her to Intercontinental to use their restaurant rest room. Then on the way there she said she is on her second day of her periods. Which I honestly don’t know whether to believe or not. Her argument was that she was uncomfortable because of the periods. So it was right on her part to leave midway.

Which is okay I guess. But planning an all nighter during your periods is a no go na. So I agreed when she said she wants to book a cab and leave for home. So I was left with nothing to do but wait it out at marine drive for 5 hours. So I hitched a ride in her cab to Andheri because I knew I would get smokes and tea there. I bought smokes. I had a cup of tea and the cops drove this cyclewala away. I hate such women. When they quit on their own plans after its made clear that something like this will leave me stuck in the middle of the night. Half of me is angry on myself for taking a chance on someone planning an all nighter at marine drive again.

I will probably never take a chance on anyone again. That night was so Deja Vu. I wish I had a better judgement of people after all the people I have met. I am now going to run my red flags for people without any leniency. I will probably sell my books on Instagram.

She reconnected in 2020, and she confessed that she had lied about being on her chums. We decided to date but she quit that chapter because I did not apply for a government job.
