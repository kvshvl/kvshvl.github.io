**How to apply for a Covid19 travel pass?**

Date: 12th May 2020

If you are stranded away from home, then these are the steps to apply for a travel pass.

1. Find a doctor for check up.

2. Then get a prescription for a covid19 test.

3. Then apply for a test at any local diagnostics centers such as Suburban Diagnostics, Metropolis, SRL, etc.

- This is a tricky process because they are not allowed to administer the test if you have no symptoms.
- They rejected my doctor's prescription which mentioned no symptoms.
- They asked me to wait at the counter, and get a fake prescription from the same doctor with minimum of two symptoms.
- The test is chargeable by law at INR 3500 if you visit a test center for sample collection, and INR 4500 if the technicians visit your home for sample collection.
- Nonetheless, the diagnostic center will charge you INR 4500 even if you visit a test centre for sample collection. i.e. they will bill you for a home visit for a sample collection that they take at the test center.

4. Then take the test.

5. Then wait for 48 hours for test report.

6. Then use that report to get a fitness certificate from the same doctor.

7. Then use that fitness certificate to apply for the travel pass on the website of the state you are stranded in.

- For example if you are stranded in Maharashtra then it is covid19.mhpolice.in
- Please Google search the website for your respective state.

A. This is a tricky process because the police will ask for a vehicle number with corresponding RC book.

- This applies even if you select the public transport option on the application.
- So assuming that you don't own a bus, you will have to be hopeful that they accept your application without the RC book.
- **So you cannot go home if you don't own a vehicle**.

B. For Mumbai, the website will direct to a emergency pass for medical cases page.

- It says, if you are a stranded student, migrant, or tourist, please apply to the local police station directly.
- Upon my visit to the police station, the cops at the police station informed that they have received instructions to issue travel pass only for interstate transit.
- They have received no instructions to issue travel pass for interdistrict transit.
- The local police advised to go home in an auto or a private vehicle.
- The autos are not allowed to cross intrastate borders.
- **So you cannot go home if you are stranded within Mumbai**.
