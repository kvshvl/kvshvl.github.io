**Taking chances**.

So trying to record this right now and it is very easy to do this. The aim is to talk for a minute about anything and keep repeating this process and keep posting to typewrighter that's all. Surprisingly the Google input keyboard works better on typewrighter than any other place that I have seen so far. so original there was thinking of posting an app like Instagram and then copying it to typewrighter but then the word limit was an issue for me also that was hard for me to spend time on moving things around from one platform to another. So now I am being a bit smarter about it and publishing only as much as I can see on my screen so the screen becomes my page. this helps me to know that every article a post out here is one page or something like that but it lets me not over talking to an article because I want to create at least about 100 thousand articles and that is what I can achieve if I spend 100 thousand minutes on this. Considering that everyday is about 1440 e minutes I can then achieve my goal in about hundred days. I understand it is a bit far fetched as a goal. But if I put in the work then I will not have to work so hard for money in my life again and again as a freelancer.
