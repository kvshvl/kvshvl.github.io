**Once more, my love**.

**Note**: This poem was created using AI in 2011.

This night I shall dream of your bedazzling golden hair,  
and tigress-eyes.

Wrapped in echoes of your mellifluous mouth-music,  
I long to sip your strawberry sweet lips.

In my dreams,  
we fly on the exquisite winged eagle of blackness,  
skimming vast continents of jungles,  
and beaches.

The depths of all the oceans of the universe shall never separate our love.

Brilliant as white doves,  
the seas greet us from afar.

In the twilight we feast on chocolate-coated marshmallows,  
and tender laugh of hearts.

Adorned in white silk,  
we pluck our twirling strawberry candies from the garden trellis.

I press the forever that you wear around your neck against my eyes-muffin so that our strawberries melt into one.

You will always be my little cakes face,  
the wild cat of my own kissing style of love.
