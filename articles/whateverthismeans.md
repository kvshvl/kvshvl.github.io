**Whatever this means**.

I can understand my complete failure in trying to to bring some kind of order in my life but that is not what I think should be something that I should focus on it is interesting to know that everything that we been doing so far has always accounted for something else elsewhere like for example learn Spanish a couple of decades ago and then I had to make and girl what come into my life and it was useful then with her so I think it is interesting to note that whatever you learn today will be useful on some other day into the future and you can never know what actually will bring value to you so you know we have this habit as architects that we we would everything that we make right from the drawings to the sketches the models even to the tissues that we use to sketch out when we are dining at restaurants and cafes all of it it is very interesting for us to hope that actually it's not for us most of US dollars we just hope that whatever we have great it will come handy someday in the future but it never does it is always like this one small part of whatever we make that comes handy like of the entire range of models and sketches and drawings that having archive in my office right now probably one f****** swan image that have drawn on some tissue paper from some cafe in Bangalore will inspire me to colour painting differently and then try to make design for house of a building from 8 which is very e unique but it is sometimes questionable I often wonder if this is what we would want to have if this is what we would want to run with like the amount of effort that you might put in trying to to build something for restore something and id3 and amount of effort that you will put into you keeping everything right there and documented in archived extract and still after all of this you are left with nothing but a small impression of an idea that you might want to use later on your life I think that is a lot of effort that you put in return for the inspiration that it gives you

no I am not saying that I am a loser I am just saying that if given a choice I would like to do things you know very not orderly fashion but a very efficient way which might be very minimalistic to begin with which might also be very rustic like a refund ages or refund the sides but then everything that I've been able to understand so far from whatever has been happening in the current economy or whatever it is been happening with everything that I have achieved so far is that most of the people that I know in my life have gone ahead we had with their lives and their careers and then everything that did you like the buy houses in the cell houses and then the do something else I am not talking about architects am talking about somebody from here to take industry or someone who did any MBA or business administration course or maybe someone who learnt how to do graphics and portfolios and stuff like that so it is very hard for me to understand what I should do next in this economy because everything around me seems to be crumbling and only way forward is blank let literally blank as white sheet of linen

the most interesting thing that I like about all of this is that I am still carrying the small amount of hope that determines me from leaving the entire practice that I've been working for running Rado because it's my own practice and alternative go and take up bank job or go work under somebody or maybe just end up doing something that is completely irrational just to make up for the deficit in my entire life style that I have been able to achieve in the past decade but the underlying factors that every architect who is very renowned and very popular in all parts of the world has gotten there at the age of 68 or 70 so now I think that no matter what I do as an architect the whole process is very slow and like for example to explain this to you I think that when you look at portfolio that is been built by graphic designer for example in that designer will normally take like it has about 10 pieces of his work then that designer will take about se a maximum of 10 days to create to sing some ABC 10 months to do it ok let's please give him like good 20 months to make doston pieces of his work still it is nowhere compared to how slow architecture can be because in architecture or normal building would take me about two years or to build and if I am building highest award in there is any initial period of 5 years that goes into it limitation and permissions and other drawings and extract that I have to get from the city council and the places to get the whole project on site so we spent about five years on paper and we spend to yours onsite so that is one project and if you just doing of Bangalore and essay we spend to yours in total from exiting from the first and flying calls to the time we give him the ki so it is extremely slow so what to do and I was able to achieve in a span of se 24 months that is good for your friend projects I might be able to achieve only one single project in the time span although I can understand that most of you would argue that the scale of the project is very different because for him it is just one square feet area of paper that is trying to design in brass I might be covering set houses of square feet in the same time but at the end of it is product is graphic image or something graphical representation of a kind and my product is building your house or something that people occupy in more like a sculpture

So now having the understanding I think it is very important for me to understand if the entire economics that you are running in USA country is it viable for me to sustain as an architect or should I do something else like problem a YouTube content creator of robbery do something else that is not related to architecture in in anyway like the whole idea of building essay wikihouse for example was based on the promise that I would get to travel from one city to another and then I could make films and landscapes and document them as I was in the journey and when I reach our destination everyday wikihouse for somebody but then the whole promise is flawed because then I will have to find someone who is willing to build a house in this economy that is out of question the second option that I had was to architectural representation of different products are going on but since economy is already lo there is no way I can do that either because and because one there is a lot of people already doing at and to badi building a house or doing a project in this economy so that leads to the third option of copywriting out drawings on posters and put meaning to people as a business venture but that might be very silly idea but that also is pretty interesting if you get it also skilled version of something maybe roza drawings will come handy sometime in the future maybe they will not baby David inspire me look at things differently maybe they will not but the whole premises to find something to do that will lead to like a lot of very creative inputs so far example like I am talking to talking into the phone into a microphone so that is article get started down because I am trying to think right now I don't have time to hold my train of thought so I could get to typing right that's why I like to use a voice note program for speech to text program but whole process am stuck on is still that I don't know what to do next it's very hard to figure out if I should probably become a researcher and give up everything I worked on so far and coverage socho Na should I just continue doing what I am doing like type in notes into typewriter and hope that after all the photo of all the time they put into the centre exercise a month of it with delete the occasion of 15 joining out long f****** articles of different kind maybe that might payoff.
