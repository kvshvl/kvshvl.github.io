**Slowly intro**.

Hi you!

My name is Kushal Dhananjay Samant.

Welcome to my feel good about myself page. :D

As for my relationship, I think going grocery shopping, and cook dinner is a fabulous date idea. I really want to find someone open to travel the world in trains with me. I want to have great conversations and a lot of sex. I'm looking for something regular and long term with or without the commitment. I want to spend time in this city, buy groceries, chill at my place with my partner, buy groceries, cook meals, eat, have 2 am conversations, rough sex, sleep, wake up to make breakfast, more conversations, movies, music, maybe art, &c.

I am an ENFJ-A. I was born in the city and grew up in the places where the streets had no names. I am an academic @dypca, aeromodeller, @airbnb superhost, angel investor, architect @kushalsamant_, author, chapter founder & dev @wikihouseproject, film-maker @youtube, lyricist @saavn, podcast host @anchor, top @medium writer, &c. I write about the programming of human behavior using architecture. By day I work on the WikiHouse project, host on Airbnb, build off the grid houses by GRÃœHAM. And by night I do architectural research projects through my architectural practice.

I am looking to have people I can chill with. Know that I can count on them. Some of them might become friends. Few of them might become best friends. And one of them will be okay being with me without tags. Then someday, someone will want me to spend the rest of my life travelling with her.

I am sending out this random letter in the auto search option. I wish I could make this unique for you, but then the app wouldn't let me. Either ways, if you want to talk to me in this global pandemic, feel free to write to me. I have made friends with many and met three people from Slowly so far. I am looking for more such amazing experiences.

I live in Seawoods. That's in Navi Mumbai. This is mostly going to be long distance. I will understand if you want to walk away because of that. You may find better guys nearby. But if we are meeting then I would like to have the option of staying over, open. Because travelling back home is a task in the middle of the night.

I love big eyes, cars, cities, cold beer, cold coffee, conversations, cooking, cuddles, cycles, design, dogs, farms, films, food, grocery shopping, long walks, maps, nature, open backs, outbacks, outdoors, Oxford comma, pizzas, random ticket travelling, rough sex, running, seafaring, silence, spontaneity, swimming, teamwork, thought processes, travel, turtles, unconditional friendships, and unusual names. What do you like?

My grand aunt is a monarch. I have stopped a country from deporting a Frenchman. I have written one, and read 999+ books.

Once I left with a roommate to have chai, got on a bus to Kerala, called Malayalee friends for a week-long free stay, & pooled money for return tickets.

The hallmark of a good relationship is a honest commitment to stay in it. This is never 50-50. It almost always is 0-100, 20-80, 40-50, 60-40, 80-20, & 100-0 over prolonged periods of time.

The week of the 3rd of January, 2018 was a week when I lived my life at weddings, travel, meeting people, and house parties. 3rd of Jan is also a date when I got my tattoo, back in 2011. There is a thing about the New Year's Week - It gives me a reality check. I am glad that this app led to remind me of my dreams.

Yours truly,
