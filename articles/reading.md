**Reading**.

Reading for the sake of reading is no good. Reading for the sake of understanding is no good. Reading only helps as a means of collecting perspectives from different authors. True knowledge comes from comparing notes, tumbling around with the information we have so gathered, and applying to our own lives. You can have read a lot, and be astonishingly stupid, make dumb moves, and have gained nothing from it.

Take my example for reference. Reading is an act of collection. The information once collected needs to be assimilated, and pondered over, and understood in the wide scale of circumstances that your mind can think of. This process of assimilation, and understanding can be best fulfilled by writing your thoughts down. In the exact way as a graphologist asks his test takers to write.

Being, continue, and end by writing your thoughts using a ballpoint pen on a piece of blank white paper. The idea is to have a non judgmental state of mind. A state of mind that is not driven by the influence of public or popular thought /opinions. The fact that the test takers have to submit this piece to the graphologist after their flow of thoughts end, requires them to have a considerable amount of trust in the graphologistâ€™s morals. A similar trust is expected from you when you are jotting down your thoughts to paper.

The whole idea being that your written word then would remain true to reality, lacking any outside influence, whether social, environmental, or spatial. Spatial reminds me that you must be alone, and your most comfortable place will you are at it. I could have scrolled up to add the previous sentence. Avoid such edits on paper.
