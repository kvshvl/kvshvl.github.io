**Clocks**.

When you are working from 8 PM to 4 AM every night, it is hard to realize how much of the news you are missing. I did not realize what the UK, and EU were upto until one of my colleagues popped the tripling of google searches on the topic, 17 hours after the vote was cast. Sometimes I feel that was a stupid thing to do. But maybe they were all being smart by checking for changes on the www. The point is I don’t think keeping the know how of the news is important enough.

If it matters to you, your friends, and family will tell you about it. People in most of the places I have been to work complained about the amount of attention my work received. I should focus more on resting they said. But have you ever given it a thought? If you are going to an office, you are going there to create something, maybe destroy something — once I worked at a cafe where they taught me how to peel of oranges beautifully, they said.

How sad! I love oranges. That was pure destruction. I quit in a week — but you go there to get something done. Isn’t it obvious that you don’t stop until it gets done? Where did these ideas of rest for the sake of closing time come from? Blame the Industrial revolution for it.

Most of us wait on the clock for that bell. I believe that by noon, most of us forget that they woke up this morning for bringing in the light. Most of us forget that they got out of that bed for a reason. But the few who remember don’t get to the sack until they are done. How much do you work?

How many hours of a week do you put in? These questions hardly make any sense when to a few of us. The ones I met did not wear watches. They would ignore the artificial sense of time, and go from one task to another. They would rest when they were waiting for updates.

Things like someone on the team sleeping the night away would annoy them. Sometimes I think this is idiotic. But then if you look at the progress they made towards things like financial freedom was phenomenal. These people did not work with the world’s dogma of a clock. They ran a measure of time beyond the cycle of days, and nights, but one that was defined by project deadlines.

Projects that were defined not by the money they made, but by progress. Progress towards living life without having to work for the rest of it. Astonishingly, most of these people are kids. 21 or so in age. And they are travelling, the world, unbound.
