**Things**.

The things that are common to you, like windy mornings, starry skies, and old trees; beetles, strawberries, and doorbells; coffee, blue jeans, and summertimeâ€¦ are not common to us.

These are things I design: books, city blocks, city plazas, commercial spaces, event venues, homes, houses, interiors, landscapes, urban design, &c.

These are things I love to do: arguments, assertiveness, being outdoorsy, books, chilling alone in a quaint cafes, cleavage, cooking dinners, dirty talking, eating 2 cheese burst chicken pizzas all by myself, erotica, events, exploring, films, gear, going out for long walks, intelligence, lazing on a cozy bed, listening to music, live music at house parties, meeting people, new information, podcasts, posting my google photos to instagram or VSCO, reliving memories, sex, sexting, sitting in the window seats of trains just for fun, tease, theatres, and writing my thoughts down.

These are foodstuffs I like: I love Butter chicken, Chicken biryani, Indian Chinese. If you want to win my heart then try a lot lot lot of Fried Lijjat Udid Papad. So basically Varan (a kind of dal), Bhaat (steamed rice), Batatyachi Bhaji (minced potatoes fried with mustard seeds, red chilli powder, and turmeric powder), Tup (ghee), Limbacha Loncha (lemon pickle), and Papad. And oh yes! Only salt water fishes like rava fried surmai.

These are things I dislike: being abandoned, afraid of taking risks, bitchy behaviour, cocaine, consumerism, drugs, fake feminism, hoarding, judging people based on their trivia or it's practitioners, lack of empathy, living by default, not reading, people not following up on promises, being pushed, pushed away, and quitting.

These are things that I don't want my girl to be: afraid of taking risks, into cocaine and drugs, consumerist, living by default, not an empath, not a minimalist, not a reader, promoter of fake feminism, and quitter.

These are things that have happened to me: I have been boycotted, spat on, stoned, ambushed, assaulted, stabbed with a pointed object, raped, catfished, and ostracized. Not been shot yet. That's the mean side of things.

But I have also been carried back from a beach, directed, dropped home when drunk, fed, helped, saved, and sheltered. That's the good side of things.
