**Do you see?**
 
Do you see?  
The mist, and the mountains tonight?

Do you see?  
The wind that blows into the land? 

Do you see?  
How beauty beat age again? 

Do you see?  
The sails that ruin the rain? 

Do you see?  
How sin can be found in the chords? 

Do you see?  
The air that reeks of smell? 

Do you see?  
How grammar changes the thought? 

Do you see?  
The cold in the dark night sky? 

Do you see?  
How bright these city lights are? 

Do you see?  
These things that block out the stars? 

Do you see?  
How no order this song has inside? 

Do you see?  
How quietly can meta survive? 

Do you see?  
It ainâ€™t no fault of thine? 

Do you see?  
Why you should never give up for some wine!
