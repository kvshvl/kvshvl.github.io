**A riding song**.

I was just riding alone;
On the way to my home.
I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.

Never did I realize;
You were riding for the sun.
If I never had cried;
In the library noon.

You would not have tried;
To keep me around.
Oh yes! I was then riding alone;
On the way to my home.

I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.
I suffered from yet another block;
Oh! This morning too soon.

Then I thought of your love;
And all it was gone.
My nose block, and fever;
Ainâ€™t it nothing for you?

No no no, I was just riding alone;
On the way to my home.
I thought to take you along;
But you were gone.
