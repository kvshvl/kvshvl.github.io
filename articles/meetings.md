**Meetings**.

Why am I so lost? What drives meetings? To be honest, last week I was not fair enough to myself, my colleagues, and my work. I slept for 12 hours a day from my otherwise 2 hour routine. That was a lot of laid back time.

Thanks to my team, the work did not suffer. But there is something that was bothering me about my body forcing me to sleep it out rather than being all “Up!, Up!, Up!”, about life. Then about two days ago I drew up a plan to push myself out of the walls of my cave. The weather was not so great that afternoon you see. I went out to meet a wedding photographer to see the potential of selling her products on our charity store.

We did a half meeting something when you know you have to rush to meet someone else, and you agree to continue it on a later date. That same evening I lined myself up to a string of meetings. One with a random architect, one with my bestie, and one with someone I had never met before. As John Lennon quotes,

> “Life is what happens to you when you are busy making other plans”.

I did only one meeting of them all. The first one. On purpose. A deliberate choice. “Why?”, you may ask.

Well I met someone. I lost myself in a conversation that made me want more of it. That made me skip dinner, convince myself it was okay being rude to everyone who was lined up. But no worries, the line up was a smart one I am sure they saw that coming when I mentioned “random architect.” The thing here is I have slept a wink after 48 hours of being lost. That’s because I could think of nothing else to do but drool.

I am up now, still half asleep with pretty interesting work meetings for the evening. What I am trying to learn is that, what was it that the wedding photographer could not crack? What made her meeting — a half meeting? What made about the next meeting made me cancel the rest of my plans? What is it that keeps people glued?

I have never felt so “Up!, Up!, Up!”. Not even when my father showed me ways to travel all my life. It is a lot of energy waiting to be deployed. It is painful. It is distinct.

It is a constant will to do something about everything. I have been deploying plans like never before. Imagine, finishing things you procrastinated about for half an year in 48 hours. There is something that still remains a mystery to me. Something I think I should find out considering the worth it has for all the people who wants to make things work.

The worth of all the ideas that can crop up if only you had this particular feeling. Honestly, I have never found something linger so indefinitely on my ever so flaky mind. I have always had a set plan when going about things. At least there is a protocol. The urgency to follow it is situational.

We, lazy ass capricorns do that. Nothing new about that. I have spent hours talking about this. I can’t hide the fact even at my deliberate, non dramatic, quiet purposeful attempts. There was something new about that meeting.

Something that kept me glued. I have written emails about this, bothered a lot of people with late night phone calls about what makes a meeting interesting? Ah! this might be something Jon Westenberg could write about. Maybe he can answer this with all that wisdom he has gathered over the years. The mystery continues.

Was it the setting? Was it the topic? Was it the weather? Was it my determination to stay out? Was it me?

Maybe not. Maybe it’s all about the people.
