**Twitter X pen**.

My issue with Twitter is that once you drop a message it becomes as impossible to find it again as to find a drop of water in the vast mighty ocean. I have often thought of not enclosing or meddling with the whole social media bubble.

Since my childhood I have noticed that the Internet as made us anew. We have gone from being result oriented peaceful societies, to loud pop culture addicts. And our actions do not hint otherwise. Not a tad bit. So whether I should pick Twitter as my final choice of an online profile should not matter to me with the force that it does. Yes, but not always. At times, help and valuable resources or valid information can be fetched from the Internet. So we need to have at the least… — hmmm actually make that, at the most, — one social media we can be involved with to stay in touch/up to date with the happenings of this planet. I know, this topic is so tiring that I did fall asleep while I pen this. But nonetheless, it was meant to provide me with me some clarity. And it did.
