**Essentialism**.

The idea is to lose yourself in nature, and find the time to nurture your creative pursuits. Emptying the hard-drive. Publishing all the work we have done for a decade on the website. Six is so-so. Last year I was on 20.

I was dead sleepy tired on the last day of the year. So much so that I could not help but sleep all the way through my birthday, and the eve, right until 9am of January 1st. That’s me being a lot lazy. That’s 48 hours mostly at a stretch. I promised myself that I would not work another day into my 26th year.

I have been bootstrapping all my ventures so far. A few things made me realise that a shift into the economic perspective of things is apparent. My team desires so, and they are correct with the effort they put into these projects. I was contacted by Prestashop about their amazing Ecommerce product. This got me thinking about using Ecommerce to fund housing.

We are not keen on becoming a marketplace but the idea seems lucrative. It might help me get some maker friends do more good work. Prestashop might save us from the hassles of funding / crowdfunding / dealing with a lot of back, and forth mailers / client projects / et cetera. This idea is to pursue essentialism. Stay in our niche of WikiHouse, and develop the platform.

But then again we are all creators. Ideas come, and go like the tide. It is often very hard to decide what we should not pursue. There might be a lot to process before we have a standard operating protocol. Besides all of that I love writing.

Maybe a book or two shall help me present our work here to the vast outside world. Getting about 2000+ reads on Medium is quite a morale boost for someone who is in the habit of emptying his mind on every opportunity he seeks. I have been asked to write, to photograph, and to create art. Some of us believe that these are some of the things I do well. But then being an essentialist, and having a basic need for variety in life doesn’t always run in sync.

With a lot of things popping up, and sleeplessness being the theme of the decade, I think I might as well shoot for us collaborating with others on a massive scale. It is in knowing that being self reliant when it comes to funding shall not only enable us to anticipate our options. But now because you have the money, asking questions like, “Do you want a house for free?” comes natural, and easy to deliver. Architects can have a bigger social impact that any other trade around the world. After all that’s the 101 of architecture — to use your intelligence to make this world a better place.
