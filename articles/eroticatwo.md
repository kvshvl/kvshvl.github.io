**Erotica 2**.

How about I surprise you, 
Sneak up to you, 
When you are just out of your bath
Have you scared, 
But when you turn around, 
You go, "Ah! It's you!"

Then I take you to the nearest wall, 
Pin you gently, 
And see you run your arms around my back, 
Push you on it harder, 
As your nipples harden up. 

Then I give you a kiss, 
As slow as they can get, 
Just place my lips on yours, 
And do nothing more yet. 

Then I cup your face is both my palms, 
And nibble on that upper lip, 
Then bit the lower one, 
To stay there kissing, 
While our hands run a different story. 

I turn you around, 
Push you face forward into that wall, 
Place my boner on your ass, 
And slip off one bra strap. 

Then slowly run my hands to your nipple, 
And circle it slowly, 
I won't stop with it, 
Until you scream and moan, 
Until you push me back on the bed. 

So I take off your tops, 
And pin one of your arms, 
Up.

Then run my tongue from the bottom of your back, 
All the way, 
Up to your mane. 

Then bite your back, 
And mark my territory, 
Just like dogs would do. 

Slide my hand, 
Down, 
And circle that clit, 
Until you beg me to stop. 

But you want to, 
Feel my boner slither, 
Mm by mm, 
Inside you, softly. 

As your moans, 
Grow louder, 
You turn your cheek, 
To kiss me on my lips.
