**Sharing my thoughts**.

I am only sharing my thoughts. Well my mind is pretty active on most days and more during the night. Now since I have found this process of creating more written content I think I will find my happiness within this. Also it helps me improve my speech which I will probably use to record podcast or to make better videos or to have a better line of thought the flow of thoughts so it makes my entire personality better. It is so so easy and simple I can't believe it. But I would like to try and I would like to make it big. Even though I am stranded in Versova Andheri and it is very difficult to get out of your because I stay outside of the city limit I think by the time I am done with this or with all the likes that you guys will give me I might be able to afford a ride back home in a Lamborghini. you know I used to visualise certain things and most of the time the come true in about 7 years but that is because I don't focus on them I have a thought analytics float into the universe and it just floats around until it comes to its own reality by itself which is kind of creepy or that is turned off satisfying for relieving because you know that something out there is actually conspiring to act out in your own favour. and that gives me the confidence to keep publishing and to keep doing my own things without having to get a job or look for stability that most people from my parents generation would love me to have.
