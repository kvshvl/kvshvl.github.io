**Happy X sad**.

There was a thought in my mind about randomness. Have you ever noticed that there is nothing that has an order. Even chaos theory needs you to look for the pattern before you can see anything. Isn’t the idea of essentialism lost here? If every time I need to find the pattern then am I not forcing the trend? 

There seems to be little that is diurnal when it comes to routine. In my entire commute from work to home, I have caught myself being in the exact same position at the exact same time observing the exact same time only thrice. I believe “Deja vu” is sheer coincidence. This is what happens when you have a lot of ideas roaming around in your head. There is very little that actually matters.

Most of those ideas are media, and popular trends. The result of which is the absence of mind. How many days can you remember? Days when you could describe the events that happened “as is”. Most of us cannot recall events before a week or two ago.

If you are a social media addict millennial then even that’s a lot to ask for. No wonder our society is breaking up, relationships seem harder, and ideas like “the frequency of conversation needs control” exist. Humans are social animals. I think they are more of political animals. They realized that being alone is not the best of the worlds.

So the political mind suggested being social was the solution. Our world is taking that too far. There is a saying that I hear often. “Too much is too bad.” The idea of making everything social loses the point.

There are places from cafes to spaces that binge on the idea of being social. They are clearly missing the point. If you are always going to be in a space filled with people, you will never appreciate the people. At times, you won’t appreciate being alone. Have you ever wondered why promenades like Marine Drive feel nice? 

That’s your mind telling you something. Listen! The times when you are most hit by depression is right after a Big Party. Drained of energy, and a low mood are something that will govern your life until the next Big Event. This is why people rush from one event to another.

They are running from themselves. Maybe not everyone of is happy with what they might find when they are alone. A bookstore in Cairo made a space that allows people to scream the stress out. It is a good thing. But the better thing would be to live in a society that does not need such devices to keep sane.

I am not blaming them but it goes to say a lot about the world we live in. We need spaces like those but only until we feel comfortable about being without them. The idea here is not to be a recluse. It is balance. With a constant stream of joy.

Now, the first thought that might come to your mind is that wouldn’t a bit of sadness be needed to maintain balance? My answer is No. “Sad is the opposite of Happy, that's Happy X Sad and Joy X Sorrow” We all aim to be happy. Happiness is a temporary thing. It comes with the other side of the coin: Sadness.

Instead if we focus on making an effort to keep joyful, our minds will be full and our hearts will feel content, and that's good enough.
