**When I lost my father**.

When I lost my father I thought I saw it coming for there was thunder in the skies, and we had about a few hundred miles to ride. For any country boy, it seemed an arduous task but when I lost my father I thought I lost a part. I often think of the things we promised from travelling to being free, from doing no man wrong to standing by oneâ€™s misdeeds. There is still a faint memory of how I asked them to pull the plug for their was life but very little left in him on that summer dusk. For sometimes you have to make a call, that shall shatter you from within but as he said when he taught me to ride I stopped thinking to just do it instead. When I lost my father I lost a cricket match I had to beg for help for a drop to the nearest pick up point. When no friends would show up a rival had mercy for this is just a small world that most live by unseen. Now I wish I would have friends again with a chance to live my life not spend time on social but making better memories. I wish for another chance I wish I had a dream, and I pray that life will show me lest what I was taught is real.
