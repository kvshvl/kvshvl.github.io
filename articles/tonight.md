**Tonight**.

After being struck in a lockdown for like the past 60 days I think that no matter how much you ask for outside help or to the government or to the police or to anybody else that you know is in power or has the capacity to help you out of this position of being stranded that you are left in, I just think I realised that I have no friends.

Most people have stopped talking to me, most people have given up on the idea of seeing again. Some have ended things because I found shelter in semi Muslim locality. While some just think that I am being reckless by not going home because they don't understand that the government has made certain laws that do not allow me to travel across the district border. and even if I somehow managed to walk across the border then I will not be allowed to stay in my own society because of the stigma that people in that region hold.

Basically I don't know what to do next but I think I will stay put and hope that I can afford to cover rent for this friend of a friend of a friend's place so I still not cause any burden to my host.

So to tonight; my first night in my own city where I feel like a complete stranger being all by myself. This feels very similar to how Kangana Ranaut's character might have felt in the movie "Queen" when her friends leave for their journeys at the club.
