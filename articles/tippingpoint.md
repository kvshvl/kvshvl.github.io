**Tipping point**.

So I think around 2018 December, I managed to drive a traffic of more than 18 million monthly unique visitors to my Pinterest account. Now this might be seem like a paid effort but it was an entirely organic deal. I am a freelancer, so i definitely don't like to invest money on things i am experimenting with. The lesson that i learnt from doing this play with Pinterest, was that to win traffic on the internet, you need content. Not good content, not bad content, but a ton of mediocre content for every kind of audience. Instead of looking at audience as a target for you, you should learn to think of yourself as a target for the audience. Be the content they want and people will flock to you. That's no news. It's obvio. It's so obvious that we often assume that everyone must have this in their minds all this while. But more often than not, it helps to bring reminders of obvious things to the table. The trick of the game is to pick one thing, and stick to it. Period.
