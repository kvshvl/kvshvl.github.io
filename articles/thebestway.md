**The best way**.

The best way to miss a person. The best way, to capture a person. Is in a book; to capture their soul, and all memories. Who do you miss the most? and who else? and who else? There will be a time, for missing you too; until then, Rest, until then. Today, a lot of things changed, for you, and I;, and for the world, in a sense. Let alone the past, locked itself, out of all bounds; and an era of pain, until you ask for forgiveness.
