**Smaller**.

If you have read Stupid White Men by Michael Moore, then you would know that Men demand bigger things. Not the women of our society, but the men. As far as I am concerned, smaller things work for me. The smaller the plate, the lesser will be the food I would want to serve myself, the lesser will be the wastage if I don’t finish eating. Also, I will be concentrating highly nutritious food on that plate now that there’s a limit I chose to run with. Smaller has an advantage. Much as the fable goes, David, and Goliath. You can complete daunting tasks by going one at it in bits. Bits, not pieces, see! That small.
