**16 years**.

So you know I started selling refills on the street at the age of 14. It has been 15 years since then and I have done a lot of things I don't know if most of them would pay off but I have started about 17 different ventures and closed about a lot of them get to a point where I had 20 email id state I would use all by myself running everything by myself all alone and solo only because I was afraid of the idea that if I take a job and all of that then I will not be able to actually live my life after my thirties.because then I will be stuck in the same cycle that most people that I have met in my life are stuck in it is kind of difficult for me to realise that how can people put so much for the giveaway so much for the money.I was brought up on the farms like I was born in the city but I was brought up where the streets had no names.and that has actually shaped most of my life in terms of the decisions I make in terms of the things I do in terms of the choices I make for myself and for the people I am with.
