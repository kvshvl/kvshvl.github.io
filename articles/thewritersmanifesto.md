**The writer’s manifesto**.

I think I should write.
Write on Medium
Share Medium on Twitter
And find a riverbank
Pull up a chair on the pebbles
A coffee table for
A small laptop
And keep typing
Not wonder a lot
About what might work out
Or what might not
Maybe carry a kindle
You know how heavy books can get
But books have a soul to them
So now I am an artist
And I want to click a photograph
Write a lot about the photograph
Not a one line caption or two
Something that might make more sense
On VSCO itself
But VSCO is more about the image
Less about the text
I want my life to be confined
To that table on those pebbles
With birdsongs floating around me
And the gushing sound of water
With only a tweet per article
And no other promotion to hoard
My life needs to be in hiding
From the world, and information flow
We are after all creators
Not consumers of the world
We add to life you see
Not steal from it, and run
So all my thoughts are limited
Limited by nature to that table
And all my dreams are realized
With every keystroke that goes unheard
This is a life too easy for me
A life where I have to do not much
A life where money is not my worry
And an escape is all that I crave for
On the earth
So I see chocolate mud
Under my grey shoes
Under a chair of rosemary wood
I wonder of all the things
Your mind can imagine
Can you feel them with the same
Tenacity, and vigour ever
But I don’t care what the world thinks of this
My small laptop keyboard is stuck
I think I should write away you see
About every living soul that I meet
And every moment when I am alive
Here.
