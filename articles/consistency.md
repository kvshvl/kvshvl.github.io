**Consistency**.

**Consistency I**.

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Like I said in the previously, compounding is a hedge against failing at consistency. This is because aa... let me tell you a story.

There was an article on medium.com a few years ago. This article was by this guy called James Clerk. well I read it at first and then I could never find it again I bookmarked it but it was taken down for some obscure reason which is still not clear to me yet. so let me just tell you just talk something I have learnt from it and let me add some of my own thoughts to it.

The whole idea behind James article was finding the what the why and how of how we succeed in life and can keep at it. One of my teachers from school used to tell me that getting to the first rank is easy. The difficult part is staying first throughout your schooling life. And I think James's article answered how to do that.

So there is a rule that I am assuming you must be very well aware of. It is called the Pareto principle. in simple terms it mean stack 20% of the effort that you put will give you 80% of the results that you get. Now Pareto who was in Italian economist who had a pea garden.

In his story, Pareto discovered his rule by observing that 20% of the pea pods where producing 80% of his peas. And then he observed this ratio in almost everything in life and which is how he came to to publish the Pareto principle. 

What James did is exactly the same thing. James Clerk planted a pee garden. But in an attempt to document and verify or understand the Pareto principle, James also installed cameras to take pictures of his pee garden. and James did not take the pictures from the top instead he took them from the side.

As a result what James observed was that the speed of the pea pods that give him most of his peas wood grow sharply when they were closer to the height of all the plants around them. And they would continue to grow slowly when they weren't close to the height of any of the other pea pods around them.

Now a plant needs three things to grow that James could not control. Light, good soil, and air. James could water all of them equally, but he could not control how much light a particular pod would get. He could not control how much of the nutrients that particular pod would absorb from the soil, and he could not control how much of the oxygen in the air around them would a pod take.

But in his observation, James showcased with photographic proof that the parts that give him most of his produce would grow at a sharply fast speed when they were closer to the height of all the plants around them.

I am continuing this in the next chapter.

**Consistency II.**

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Continuing from the previous chapter, what James inferred was that in the human perspective this is how things would play.

Now imagine an Olympic race or rather an Olympic swimming contest. This is what James called "The Winner Takes It All" syndrome. In an Olympic contest the difference between a winner and the person who comes as a runner up, can be defined by a split microsecond. But the reward that someone who comes second gets is nothing. Zero. Zilch... compared to the report that the winner gets. The winner will get better coaching better sponsorships better events better leagues the gold ofcourse and other things that come with winning. Which means that now the winner is in a position to compete better. 

You have to remember that the winner is being able to get all the goodstuff due to a slight difference in performance. Which means that the winner has to be slightly better in every race when compared to all his competitors to keep up on this winning spiral.

Now in a very common real world scenario that is you and me. For us, it means that next time you go to a job interview, you don't have to be the best in class or the gold medalist at the university or the best in your field to crack the job interview. All you have to do, is to be slightly again slightly better than the other applicants.

Remember "slightly".

I will continue this in the next chapter.

**Consistency III**.

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Continuing from the previous chapter. Remember "slightly"? That is the key to understand how the Pareto principle works.

Now in my understanding the thing that you will learn in this chapter is one of the best takeaways from James Clerk's work. It is the "Why?" of the Pareto principle.

Why does the Pareto principle work?

This is sort of a long story, but the answer lies here. Here's how. There was a guy called Denis Diderot. His greatest contribution towards is that he is the sole author of the original encyclopaedia. He was a French Man and he led a very poor life. Until the queen of France appointed him as the chief librarian of France. She also gave him a monthly stipend for his simple lifestyle. All was well until one day some aristocrat gave Denis a purple robe.

The purple robe. It is very popular as a story. Diderot fell in love with his robe. One day, a famous French painter made a painting of Denis Diderot and his purple robe. As a result, Diderot noticed how all his other belongings would appear dull, grim, and poor in comparison to his royal robe. 

So he started spending his money on buying things that would go well with the robe. Soon enough he ran out of money. On knowing that her chief librarian has gone broke, the queen of France did it again. She gave him a lot of wealth again.

Diderot started spending his wealth again. To cut the long story short, soon enough, Denis Diderot's robe appeared dull, grim and poor in comparison to his other belongings. Diderot went broke for the second time.

This is popularly known as the Diderot effect.

Remember "the Diderot effect". I will continue in the next chapter.

**Consistency IV**.

Do you know how powerful consistency is?

Remember "the Diderot effect"? Continuing from the previous chapter. This is what the takeaway from it is.

Why does the Diderot effect work?

When you give something you are also setting yourself up to give a bit more of yourself. For example, when you buy running shoes because you want to go running every morning, from reasons varying from, " looks cool" to "you want to say healthy": you are also setting yourself up to spend on the socks, your shorts, your running Jersey, and maybe an iPod because duh music!

This is what happened with Denis Diderot.

What you see is the backward spiral of "The Winner Takes It All" effect/syndrome. It also happens with slight changes but in the wrong direction. Remember slightly" from the first chapter about consistency?

Itis important to know that when you enter any spiral good or bad, your journey on it will often continue due to slight changes that you make. This will continue to the point when you are at your worst. Yes, the good news is that even the backward spiral has a limit.

When anything you do will be better than everything you have done so far. This means that whatever you do next will mark a shift in progress in the forward direction.

The takeaway (from chapters 1, 2, and 3 of this article) is that the defining quality which keeps a spiral going forward to backward to again forward, is the consistency with which you make slight progress in any direction.

Consistency can solely chart your journey through life at a positive beginning or a negative ending or at a negative beginning and positive ending or any end result that you would like to reach.

If you understand this then all you know that you have to keep creating and making an effort. Good or bad doesn't matter. After all everything is like a sine wave. The general law of nature is that whatever goes up has to come down, and whatever goes down will come up.
