**Circles**.

I think this is one of the rare posts agar aap not asked question before beginning to talk about it. I mean within this lockdown. Soyabean trying to not pick a topic and write a lot about it. The only trouble with this approach is that when I don't have a cold to talk about I end up wasting time trying to find a topic to write about or I end up looking at different ideas running parallel or intersecting each other or I just end up going around in circles. no matter how I look at this problem I will think I will need a group of people who will be able to suggest different topics that I can contribute to in the form of writing.

Or maybe I can build a pool of words that I can pick at random and write about. Honestly speaking I think it would be great to be able to get suggestions of topics. This is something like what the haikujam app does. But I agree that their idea is a slight variation of what an actual haiku is. But it's a good thing to learn from something that might not be creating the best of its own craft.

Learning again then becomes a byproduct of making mistakes by going around in circles.
