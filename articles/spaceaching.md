**Space aching**.

Time, space, place & play. Often we seek spaces that resonate with the depths of our darkness. A reflection that is subtle like the glow of a street lamp. Our most memorable moments are hidden in these alleyways. Their influence transpiring all space, and time. A space that is a replica of our mind. A time that is mind play.

A place where the wind blows the fuel inside our thoughts.

Like a setting sun under a bridge, and the cold wind upon nightfall. Find me there at peace for eternity. When the quiet stays unbound. Willingly as it may seem, without the clutches of being time bound.

But I have often found that addition of an architectural piece in a village’s fabric does some keeda with the people. Their sense of freedom which lies in the fields, and the countryside now feels challenged by the staunch neatness of the new neighbour.

They aspire to be that neat. They aspire for that progress…materialistic progress. But hasn’t human aspiration always been about discovering, and experiencing the new? The stuff that we speak of wanderlust, and living like gypsies? The desire to travel? Does all of it fade away in the pursuit of beauty in other things? Is this what is happening to this city?

Now, I am not against big bank balances. But is the purpose of it fundamentally flawed? Is it questionable? Is it a clear ‘yes’? Is Mumbai losing itself in the materialistic version of the human adventure spirit?
