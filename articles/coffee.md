**Coffee**.

Is it time for some coffee already?

It might be sort of very annoying for a lot of us to figure out how do we tackle this ongoing economic crisis that the entire planet probably is facing. Now I don't have an answer for that but I can share something from my past experience which might make some sense to solving your own personal economic crisis. The mistake that I have often done is to stop myself from contributing to the one single task that gives me any kind of returns. Has social beings, we measure returns by their size, or scale, or something else that affects the amount of respect our peers grant us. This outlook is a mistake.

A better thing to do would be to find something that is non zero. Find anything that is giving you a return that is not zero. And then triple down your effort on that one single thing. Your efforts will keep generating returns that keep compounding if you are consistent. This consistent effort that generates a non-zero return is the answer to solve your own personal economic crisis.
