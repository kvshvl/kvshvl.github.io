**Journeys**.

I've always thought journeys to be a part of my learning experience. Like I have never seen things with different perspective unless if I were on a journey from one place to another. Once I was travelling in this train from CST to Thane and I happened to look outside the door because I was standing right at it. What I saw was series of buildings that were being constructed, half done, weirdly placed, and will work in progress for somebody. But what I realised was because I thought about the Whys. I used to always question why have they placed it that way? Why is it weird? Why is it half done? and more. So I used to look at all of these things as a set of ideas that must have come to someone. All these things around me outside of the train were only thoughts. Everything you see is a thought floating around. Everything. And once you understand this you can realise that if you can think, then you can also create whatever it is around you or create a new world of your own making all by yourself, without having to worry about the Hows. The how lies in the doing. The doing of following your thoughts relentlessly.
