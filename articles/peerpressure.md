**Peer pressure**.

I don't know if you have noticed but you know we can do a lot more if we complicate things. I lost this thought but I am trying to remember it from a glimpse. I was looking at this web development course n Coursera, thinking of all the things you can do if you learn web development. You can be a true minimalist because you won't need any social media accounts to store your own data. Having said that, when I look at Paul Graham's website, it is minimalistic by design, but the content is heavy.

Not the words, but the depth in them. He talks of computers, mathematics, programming, and things like that. I have a simple website, too. But I don't possess that depth of knowledge. So I talk of simpler things.

Obviously, Paul is at the top of your game, I am not. Maybe at times, instead of trying to keep things simple, we should describe things in the utmost complicated manner, since adding depth to anything has been most beneficial to society at large. This reasons how people with messy desk-space may be smarter than those with OCDs, neatly organized desk-space. We do not know for sure, at least I don't. Anyway, the former dons complexity while the latter, simplicity.

It is often been said that 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication'. This reasons how people with OCDs, neatly organized desk-space are smarter than those with messy desk-space. Now if you can imagine, I think the trick lies in the transition: from being the person with OCD to accepting that the messy table is organized in its own ways. The ability to stay complicated or simple, but to accept that there is a sense in either. This acceptance is how you have a better chance of winning than your peers.
