**Also, on a different note**.

Also, on a different note, I was crossing the Vashi bridge yesterday. It was raining, and these harbour line trains usually sway in the strong winds on that bridge. You could see how everyone around the big doors is anxious. It's as if this train ride might be the last moments of your life. But the rain was beautiful. It was so scary that I thought that if everything you wanted becomes true, every thought you have had will come true, then I would want to think of living or just being alive. In that moment, I realized this: Everybody must have had a bad day, but not everyone was mulling over it. Some of us in the train were, not worried, or blank, or just being happy. Being happy was not something that happened to anyone of us, it was a choice these happy faces made. In the same way as worrying was also a choice I made. It was as intense as the choice to live, when those winds last night scared all of us in that train. So, staying happy needed our conscious attention, just like anything else in life.
