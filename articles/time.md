**Time**.

Now I donâ€™t know what you were doing when you picked this up. But you should stop and ponder. There are many reasons why it is essential to cut down the things that we do. Time is a thing. It is an asset only if you do something with it, much like money or any other asset.

Count the minutes. If you notice in this lockdown you would have experienced days go by without realising how much time you have lost. So I very recently found out that if I try to live life like Elon Musk or other people of that genre, then I would literally have to count the minutes. I think this happened because I went to bed early last night and I woke up today morning and have gotten a lot done in the first 54 minutes of my waking day. And I been very woke and aware of each passing minute.

Now this is a state of mind that I find to be really nice. It just tells me that I can achieve a lot in my entire day, more than what I would have achieved on a normal week. As we all know time is relative factor in life, it changes as per our emotional state, experiences, feelings, and presence of mind. ped good changes if you choose to be present in the moment you can also choose to be aware of every passing minute which leads to give you the complete control over your day and the things that you choose to react to or respond to or to pass. You can also then notice how much you can get done more if you keep a track of every minute, albeit not in a literal sense but in a conscious sense.
