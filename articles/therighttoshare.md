**The right to share**.

The right to share. I believe this should be a fundamental right. Just like the others listed in our constitution. I know there can be more material thought to be derived from this.

Considering how much can we achieve when we share our resources, and not exchange them against each other. Ask those amongst us who have spent their university years, living in hostels or with roommates. The core belief is that sharing encourages access whereas exchange discourages access.
