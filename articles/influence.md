**Influence**.

In my past, I was fired in situations as people vied for influence. I have been shown how important, this power over someone or something can be. Our world is shaped by influence. Free Will is an illusion. Some people are true bred consumerists for the reason that the market influences their own judgement to an extent that they consider their entire lives to be a product of free will.

A close friend once told me that I was influenceable. That means you can influence me with ease. At that age, I found that reality bothersome. There was a need to control actions. A need to demonstrate control over life.

Now however, I realise that we are humans. Humans, by default, are influenceable. This sure is vulnerable. This, like any other vulnerability, is powerful. The power lies in knowing what influences you.

Once you know what does, and how it does, you have won half the battle. The other half lies in catching yourself. The more number of things that you can find to have an influence over you, the more power you will have. The ideas of fashion, beauty, and make-up are prevalent for a sole reason that these ideas are projected as a necessary element in human life in advertising. Popular media holds a large influence on human lives.

Mostly for the reason that it is popular. I find that toxic. As you grow older, popularity recedes into the shaded patch down the memory lane. The things that influence you change. Your interests, hobbies, and decisions, are based on ideas that are not your own.

If you are not careful, influence can suck you into living a life that you never really wished for. Self awareness is the antidote. Wish for wishes that make you burn as an individual. Wishes that make you rise up from those ashes like a Phoenix.
