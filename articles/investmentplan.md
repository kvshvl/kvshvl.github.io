**Investment plan**.

I had a thought about investment management.

1. Biz account 100%
This is bank account #1.
All incoming funds should come to this account only.

1.1. Tax account 33% of 100%
This is bank account #2.
Transfer tax amount to this account and pay tax using this account only.

1.2. Biz expenses 33% of 100%
This is bank account #3.
All office expenses should be spent from this account only. Marketing cost should be limited to less than 10% of expected gross revenue.

1.3. Investment account 34% of 100%
This is bank account #4.
All other payments listed below should be made from this account only. 

1.3.1. Home expenses 16% of 34%
For food, rent, outings, and utilities.

1.3.2. College Fund 16% of 34%
For education of progeny.

1.3.3. Retirement account 16% of 34%
For mutual funds.

1.3.4. Market 16% of 34%
For share market, and stock trading.

Cash accounts.
1.3.5. Emergencies 16% of 34%
For medical emergencies.

1.3.6. Real estate 16% of 34%
This is cash for buying property.

1.3.7. Parents 4% of 34%
For supporting parents.
Start calculating backwards from here.
