**Mohave**.

Out in the desert,
as a wind blows,
she saw in herself,
angst some more.

She could write stories,
some of her own,
of the past few weeks,
some months old.

A cold wind blew her dinner,
from those embers as they glow,
but she couldnâ€™t care less,
she felt sore.

With all the tech around her,
to carry or hoard,
is it not a lot on your baggage,
to lose some, and snore.

Someday with unforgiving loneliness,
time will solve it all,
as you pass through Mohave,
through heat, and cold.
