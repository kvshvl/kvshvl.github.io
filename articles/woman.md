**Woman**.

you know how to make me drool
worry about everything like a fool
looking out at dead stars
with their light sparkling above me
wishing you were right there
kissing me slowly in the dark
:*

roam about not in the streets 
looking for things where they aren't supposed to be. 
search you heart, 
what you have been looking for 
has been there the whole time.

do words turn you on?
or is it just something cheesy
a double burst pizza
or having me after a meal?

poetry, prose, sonnets and ballads 
enriched with words so sweet
that made hearts flutter
something our generation is bereft of 
as today, your place or mine takes predence

awwww
can I move to you?
I have never found anyone who will write back to me
I guess we were destined to happen
because when everything else is a blur
you are the sweet sound of life
blinking in my eyes

"que sera sera,
we will be what will be" 
you could move to me 
and still be a thousand miles apart 
for a change, stay 
perhaps, not five feet close 
but not even a thousand light years apart!
