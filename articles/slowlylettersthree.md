**Slowly letters 3**.

Can I know your first name? It helps add context :P Maybe if we run into each other someday. :) Yes I got bored of writing a bio, so I have my website bio here :P Well it clearly works to get people to reply to me :D

Thanks! For all of these compliments. :)

I never knew Kolkata was called the City of Joy. What kind of research do you do? I might move to Bangalore to complete a research and publication project at an architecture firm there :) I lose my patience when people cannot discuss things calmly and in-depth :P What all are you learning currently?

I agree you are single because you might not have the freedom to get guys over :P I like people who hate selfies :D The beard and face project was an exception :D What's on your bucket list? Where all have you lived, and traveled so far?

How big is your garden? Is there anyone who doesn't love Coldplay? :D

Happy Christmas to you too!!!
Yours truly,

P.S. You can see my pictures on my Instagram. I am currently curating my entire photo archive from Google Photos on it.
