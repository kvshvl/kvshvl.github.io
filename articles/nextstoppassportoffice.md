**Next stop passport office**.

I got a new passbook where the new printing machine printed the transaction page on the first page.
So, I got another new passbook on which the lady on the window updated the first page from her computer.

But, this page has the old address.
So, kyc records update nahi hua hai.

Because, the lady who was supposed to do it is on a 3 day leave.
So, they asked me to come on Monday.

So I had some coffee outside, then went back in the bank.
Took debit card, and internet banking form.

Tab the BM was free, so I went there and asked her if she can check status of my KYC application.
She asked for my Aadhaar, and PAN card.

She was doing the data entry herself.
So I told her that I want the Seawoods ka address on the first page because I am applying for my passport.

So she asked me for proof.
I told her that she had taken the rent agreement.

So she got the Seawoods ka address on the front page.
So I left the cabin, filled the debit card, and netbanking ka forms.

The lady on this counter asked me to get it signed from the BM.
So I skipped that, and stood in line for the single window to ask that lady to print my first page information on the last page of the passbook because address change hua hai.

She asked, "kab?"
I said, "abhi."

She asked, "last page, kisne bola?"
I said, "BM ne."

So she did that.
Then I asked the guard ki gum ka bottle kahan hai.

He said, "andar hoga."
So I took that gum ka bottle from the back office.

Put 2 photos on my passbook.
Old and new address ke baju mein.

Then I went to the BM.
Asked her to stamp both the photos.

And sign on both the forms.
Then I gave the forms to the Netbanking counter.

This lady activated it.
Then she said I will get the cards 7 days mein.
