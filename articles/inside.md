**Inside**.

Because they are not straight the nosing is off but you were taught here, and you don’t know a lot but since we all have been to such a place. Hopefully we try to escape every other terrain jot down our thoughts on drawings instead. This is not my poem but people don’t wait they don’t know what was destined for every other thread. You can rant along but this is not a rant this is realising that in the end the only way that you will find answers is to look inside.
