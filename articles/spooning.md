**Spooning**.

How I wish to spoon, 
And massage her back, 
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And grab her ass; 
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And feel her hair;
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And kiss her neck; 
At the same time.

How I wish to spoon, 
And find her a robe; 
At the same time.

Oh! How I wish to spoon, 
And tear her clothes; 
At the same time.

But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ my vision will blur out; 
At the same time.

But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ my fantasies will come out; 
At the same time.

But spooning be not good, 
Coz’ I will fall in her arms, 
With the same joy.

Asleep.
