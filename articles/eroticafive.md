**Erotica 5**.

I want to meet you in a wedding, find you in the crowd, from the other family's side. Look at you, and catch your gaze. I ask you, "Do you know where the rooms are?" I let you grab my hand, and show me where. Then let you go there with the keys. I follow you there, and close the door. I rip away your saree on the door, go down on you, and eat your clit, till you beg me to stop, so I ask you to sit. Then I pull you by your saree by that knot on your navel, and undo your hair.

I turn you around, and press my cock on your ass. You can feel it through the clothes but you still moan. So I turn your neck, and nibble your lips, with my hand still on your clit. Then push you down, till your face is flat on the bed, with your ass up, and a vagina that's ready and wet. You undo my belt without seeing it, and gasp as you hold my boner, you ask me to fuck thee. Then I pin you down and slide it in, as slowly as I can, we hear the wedding drums begin.

I want to fuck you to that drumbeat, until you can't take it anymore, till you gasp for breathe slowly sweating, with my fingers pinching your nipples, and my teeth undoing your lingerie. As my sweat drips from my face, on your back and you ask me if I am done yet. I politely say, "No bitch, we aren't going home tonight!" You ask me to stop, and don't stop in the same line.

Then you say, "How about bringing your mouth to my boobs, slowly caressing them with your lips before sucking on my nipples" So I turn you around, and slide it in, going all missionary and tearing all your clothes, cup your boobs, and suck on both the nipples together. As you leave deep nail marks on my back, burning as our sweat runs over that.

As you pull at my hair, I ask if you are married, you say, "Yes, aren't we both? ... "Stop thinking!" ... And fuck me harder please!" And when I finally come up for air, you kiss me hard, bite my lips, and let some blood out there. So I slow down because I don't want to quit, I hear your moans go louder than that drumbeat until I cum inside you once, and you ask me to do it all over again. You suck my balls, slowly chew on my cock. You say, " Don't you do it because you can never have enough of me" as I get a better boner.

You run your tongue from the bottom to the tip of my dick, I see you look up at me wide-eyed as you suck my dick and that turns me on even more. Then you clamp that head in between your lips and touch the tip with your tongue gently. As it gives me a freezing sensation, my body shivers, legs go weak, and I hold your hair with such a forceful grip, begging for mercy to let me live. You ask me to byheart your number before we leave because you want to ride me in your house's balcony.

You want me to lift you up, and fuck me in the cold wind, sweating while your husband is in the other room, fucking his colleagues, 3, maybe 4. So I let myself go, and my cock oozes with glee, you drop all of it on your forehead, and it drips down slowly, from besides your eyes, down your nose, over a lip, and some goes inside your mouth as you open to tongue my cock some more.

Then it drips down your chin like a never-ending river, drops on your chest, and rolls down your boobs, all the way down to your stomach, and navel. You blow me so hard, I fall exhausted on you. But my cock is now on your face, cumming away, till it goes to your clean-shaven pussy, and you scream, "oh! no, I don't want you to get me pregnant" So you rub it off as it overflows, down on the bed.

You say, "We have a mess of this place, let's run away before anyone knows! Find me a blanket, get me my clothes!" So I get you, your clothes from the hotel room, then we slip away back into the crowd again. I look at you and catch your gaze. Pretending to never have known you, but now a flashback to go to time and again. 

Phew!
