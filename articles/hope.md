**Hope**.

Today I saw this beautiful woman at some shop in Sher-e-Punjab. Like cat eyes, fair, and she had a cold, Stuck in traffic. The share passenger, the cab driver, and me were being all Manjunath at her. Until people started honking. And I was thinking, good but my girl be better.

Your eyes, and the way the light falls on your face, the way your skin glows under a haze, gives me hope, gives me hope.
