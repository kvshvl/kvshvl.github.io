I find it rather interesting how the Indian government has now made the train routes go from all the states to the central region that is the national capital region of Delhi. For for most people it just seems that they running trains but what I see is that it's a very small ploy to inspect and measure the infection of covid19 in India. More than being logistic kal decision I think that when you get of the train at Delhi they will by routine for the thermometer to your forehead and check the temperature. This one action is basically the centralisation of monitoring the spread of this infection. To be honest I think it is a smart move.

It may not be better than what I thought would be ideal to do that is sending teams to every household like when you host a census. Although you may think that asking lives of all the people in these teams, but the current approach taken by the Indian government risks the life of not just person holding that thermometer but the lives of everybody on the trains. In a very ratio and proportional perspective, you are putting a lot at stake as a government when you mobilise the same people that you have current time for over a period of 60 days without doing any accurate testing to differentiate the carriers of the virus versus the people who are infected and are facing the symptoms versus the people who are completely removed from this population.
