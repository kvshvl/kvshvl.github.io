**Abyss**.

This picture reminds me of hierarchy. A man looks down on another, while being idle himself. The way this society prides upon its idle-being than those industrious-beings. With the background showing two buildings posing for the shot. Gaudy at their best, aspirational properties for those who lie in the foreground. If you look closely, the worker, and his tools are in the shadows. And the people who owns those posy buildings too. Remember that, all those who win are toiling away in the background. All work happens behind the scenes. The lesson here is that, “All work happens pre-season. Throughout your life you can see that those who are rich are so because they do the things that the majority are lazy to do. The fishermen can afford boats that cost more than your paycheck. The farmers own estate. Thinking about such paradoxes, I wonder if these men working on the foreground, were paid to be here buy the means that own these buildings. It is strange how men have structured civilization in selling everyone a dream, that even adults believe in. I am not against being employed. I am against not compounding my time with efforts that reap in perpetuity. That’s an abyss. Getting through this abyss means going hungry for a decade, and reaping your rewards in perpetual eternity.
