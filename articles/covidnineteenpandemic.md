**Covid19 pandemic**.

"I think NatGeo cooked SARS-Cov-2 /myth (because #Covid19 only to those who are already ill w: cancer, diabetes, due for surgery), so with media spreading fear, you agree to spend more time at home. *It's good for nature*, PLUS More WFH lifestyle means you use more AT&T WiFi (1. owned by NatGeo) to watch Netflix (1.), PLUS you pay more to a private electricity company (hospitals and #Covid19 pay pharmaceutical industry, you don't) - is how World Bank (because WHO labels #Covid19 a pandemic) funds to governments/corporations, shows up as salary hikes, and gets converted to white money."

What do you think?
