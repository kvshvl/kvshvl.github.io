**$15 Design Guide**.

This guide is made of 15 chapters. The title is a way of saying that each chapter is intended to bring an extra dollar to your artwork. These chapters can be used standalone, or paired with any other chapter/s in permutations and combinations to bring your work an extra dollar. I hope that my ideas are helpful and universal in nature.
