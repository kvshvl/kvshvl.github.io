**Running**.

Running across different plains, as we see the green pass by, with every turn in turn it stays, a high that drives our innate joys. I wonder if there is an end to all the things that seem to cry, there are not many things around, from an early sunrise to moonlight, that will bring a smile to my empty face, that will make me feel better inside. For today I feel so low, for every person, and every thing, that I have tried or given to, has crushed my inherent belief about myself. The only thing that shall save me is unknown, is unknown, is lost within an endless rhyme, and I am running to find out the why. But maybe I should just stop still, let the wind blow by me, show me what is thatâ€™s missing, let me realize. That every day, and every tide, comes again on a distant stride, we must make right all our wrongs, for this time is all we have, for this time is a blessing in disguise.
