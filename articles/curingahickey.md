**Curing a hickey**.

1. Water in a steel glass.
2. Frozen for 12 hours.
3. Pressed this steel glass on the hickey for 30 mins, with gentle massaging at intervals.
4. After 60 mins, stretched the skin, and rubbed this steel glass over the hickey for 30 mins, with gentle massaging at intervals.
5. Slept in a warm coziest blanket I could find, and hoped that my logic about capillaries, skin, and temperature would work.
