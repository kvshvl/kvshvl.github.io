**Etched**.

5 becomes 20, 20 becomes an age, age I spend with wonder, wonder that shall we ever remain the same, same as our fantasies, fantasies of lust, lust for a love, love for each other. Other day another time, time for a company, company of her, her thoughts plunder, plunder my restless soul.
