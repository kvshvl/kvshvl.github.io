**The joy of not wearing a seatbelt**.

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
My mind went out with glee. 

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
Six months later you see. 

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
I enjoyed the crowd. 

Today, I travelled in a local train. 
Emptied my mind aloud. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
To travel in the city. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
To save some money for me. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
For hours in traffic. 

For six months, I took an uber. 
How crazy can that be. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
No, not two or three. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
A dream since I was sixteen. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
I am now in the core team. 

For an year, I worked on a project. 
I cannot believe. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
Feels wild, and free. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
Feels like a local maybe. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
Opens the mind for me. 

The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. 
I might meet god instantly. 

P.S: The joy of not wearing a seatbelt. Try it only in a train.
