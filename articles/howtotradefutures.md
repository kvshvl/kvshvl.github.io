**How to trade futures?**

Albeit complex methods exist which include the use of indicators, graphs, and mathematics, the simplest and time-tested strategy for trading futures is called the UP-DOWN strategy.

Trading means that you have to predict whether the exchange rate will go UP or DOWN **within** the time you choose, after you open the trade.

**Note**: I used the word '**within**' because if you see that the chart isn't going the way you chose,  
then you can cancel your bet by clicking on 'close the trade' before the time is up and save yourself from loss.

In the UP-DOWN strategy, it does not matter whether you choose UP or DOWN to start.

Start by investing, the minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, for the minimum time allowed.

In most platforms, this will mean $1 for 1 min.

1. UP: Letâ€™s say you pick UP, $1 [$1 + $0], and 1 min.  
Here, $0 is the total unrecovered loss.

If the chart goes UP, as you predicted, then you get your initial $1 + profit i.e. 70 to 90% = $1.70 to $1.90.

2. DOWN: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case, DOWN, $1 [$1 + $0], and 1 min.  
Here, $0 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go DOWN, as you predicted, then you will lose $1 total.

3. UP: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case, UP, $2 [$1 + $1], and 1 min.  
Here, $1 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go UP, as you predicted, then you will lose $2 total.

4. DOWN: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case DOWN, $3 [$1 + $2], and 1 min.  
Here, $2 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go DOWN, as you predicted, then you will lose $3 total.

5. UP: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case UP, $4 [$1 + $3], and 1 min.  
Here, $3 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go UP, as you predicted, then you will lose $4 total.

6. DOWN: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case DOWN, $5 [$1 + $4], and 1 min.  
Here, $4 is the total unrecovered loss.

Now let's say the chart does not go DOWN, as you predicted, then you will lose $5 total.

7. UP: Now for your next trade, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case UP, $6 [$1 + $5], and 1 min.  
Here, $5 is the total unrecovered loss.

If the chart goes UP, as you predicted, then you get your initial $6 + profit i.e. 70 to 90% = $10.20 to $11.40.

8. DOWN: Once a trade is successful, pick the opposite value of your last choice, minimum amount allowed + total total unrecovered loss, and minimum time allowed.

In this case DOWN, $1 [$1 + $0], and 1 min.  
Here, $0 is the total unrecovered loss.

If the chart goes DOWN, as you predicted, then you get your initial $1 + profit i.e. 70 to 90% = $1.70 to $1.90.

**Always**:

- Always alternate between UP and DOWN for every trade (UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN) regardless of whether your previous prediction was successful or not.
- Always choose the minimum time allowed for every trade.
- Always have patience inspite of loss.
- Always invest the minimum amount allowed for the first trade.
- Always invest the minimum amount allowed + your total unrecovered loss, if you make a loss.
- Always stick to this process.
