**Mind**.

It is funny how our mind works. It is funny how we can tell a lot about people in the first instance. Our brains are databases, designed to give us a match from it’s storage for all our queries. That’s why most of the time we find that the design solution we began with is usually the best answer to any given problem. I read this in one of the books from the Bourne series.

I have found this to be true but then again, maybe what you believe in is what you will see. “How you do anything is how you do everything — even the way you wash utensils. Whether you choose to focus on cleaning the murk or do you focus on doing it till you run out of soap.” A Hungarian friend once told me that the way someone eats at the table is the way everything you need to know about someone. Maybe that’s why dates are dinner dates, and we close deals on lunch.

I thought of starting this article from here but then I drifted, and now I am being meta about it. How we write, tells so much more. Our mind is fascinating. It can see beyond itself, be the observer or the subject or both. This is what has always amazed me.

The way it searches for that one word which will fit in the context. The search for a word, that search for perfection, and the way it always attains it. This might be a hint so as to why perfection is not a myth. Maybe we have not learned to recognize it. The mind can see words sprawling, lying there in the vast emptiness of its own imagination.

Can you feel the ever tightening grip of that emptiness on your brain? Can you feel how when you rush the way you write, the nervousness of the brain to find the perfect word to feed the rush? Maybe we can say that the brain feeds to itself what we feed it. Sometimes even when we stop. Maybe this is true, “Which wolf will win?

He replied, “The one you feed.” It has been my experience about most of the thoughts I have had on certain days. Days when my belief in everything around me is so high, for I can step without looking back or flinching a tad bit onto a blazing freeway, and experience no harm come my way. The thoughts that run through my mind in these subtle moments, seems to manifest themselves in roughly about 7 years. Deja Vu, anyone?
