**Brida 1**.

I wish there was a way to say or see the things that you are as I trod my favourite curve or see you limp on a path. There is so much for you to be so much for my words fall short but in you I see an angel in you I see a star as broken, and bruised you might be on you I see no scar. I see a glow thatâ€™s tender, innocent of the world afar, I see a joy so blissful, that my heart melts apart, and alone lies your blank stare that stops me in my tracks, and shows me how I blunder a search that I need not start.
