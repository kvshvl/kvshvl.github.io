**Third approach**.

I believe that the way you do anything is the way you do everything.
So, by that logic, the way I cook Maggi is the way I do everything.
It means that the speed at which I boil the broth is also the speed at which I would do most other things.
It goes to mean that if I rush the boiling process, then I will rush most of the other processes that I do.
And as a result, most of the results in my life would be similar to the results that I get with cooking Maggi.

So, cooking Maggi being a process that most of the common folk do, you can gain an insight on your habits. Of the many prevalent methods, I have observed that I cook it in three distinct ways. The common steps here is to empty all of the ingredients in the pot in the beginning because that how I do most things. The difference lies in the heat (effort), and time.
1. High flame - When you boil the broth on a high flame to turn it viscous faster.
2. Med flame - When you keep at stirring the broth slowly, and on simmer until the water turns viscous.
3. Low flame - When you keep it on simmer, and to let it be. If I don't stir it until its boiling, then the broth tastes better.

What I learnt from these three experiences is that,
1. I can either rush things, and get them done, but they don't taste good for long.
2. I can decidedly go slow, and get things done, but they taste superficial.
3. I can let things be, and let them happen, so that they give me a new experience of their taste.

So the third approach is the ideal way of doing things in life. This is true for Maggi, and relationships as it is for most things in life.
