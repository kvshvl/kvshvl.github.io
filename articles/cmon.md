**C’mon**.

Step up to the unknown, it’s beautiful inside
With beach sand flowing, into the high tide,
These moments disappear, with a frightful force,
Every cop patrolling, these sands last night,
Little to be lost, staring at the horizon behind,
Within a cloud of seamist, lies the unknown,
Beckoning my soul, to the depths of an ocean,
Cries of seagulls, and a big shoal.

C’mon, C’mon, C’mon.
