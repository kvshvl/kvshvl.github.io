**Zomato in bad weather**.

So I haven't' been to this place, Smoking Pizza, Nerul, Navi Mumbai. But my mom got her Zomato Gold. Pretty excited about it, so she ordered 1+1 Cheese Burst Pizzas through her new Zomato Gold. Although she got a 3rd Pizza because I think there is an offer ongoing here, this is going to be a pretty bad review. For the following reasons.

1. The Zomato Delivery guy delivered the pizza that where all spilled sideways. 

Now I don't know if the restaurant gave it to him that way, or if he dropped it on the roadside.

2. The Zomato Support team fucked up.

My brother spoke to the Support team at Zomato. He sent them one image showing these 3 Pizzas kept next to each other to help them access the damage. Apparently, the support team seems to be having a chilled out time this Thursday evening. Like c'mon, I have worked at Scootsy, but we had a basic human work ethic and standards there. They prolonged the chat to a point where the phone's battery died. So now I don't know if there is a refund initiated. No one even bothered to call us up to check on this situation.

3. I am hungry.

It is 11.00 in the night, and unusually friggin' cold in Seawoods tonight. You know how the Navi Mumbai weather is: cold, wet, and windy. You know what? To my surprise, the Pizzas are also cold, splashed inside the box. Not a pretty sight. 

4. After all this jazz, I tried to take a bite of one slice.

Or whatever you want to call this gooey mess: I swear to God I almost puked on the taste. The bread was rough, brittle, scrapped my tongue. The cheese tasted funny. The chicken was almost not well cooked. 

5. So that's why this review is giving the restaurant 1 star. 

I would give them less than zero but Zomato doesn't let the users give such low standards: Irony or maybe pretense of having standards.

The idea of posting this review is that: 

1. I want this restaurant owner to kick Zomato's team's ass and make them buckle up their game.

2. I want Zomato to kick his ass, so that he makes better food.

In conclusion: 

Everyone fucked up. 

Yes, you can try and blame it on the weather, but alas.
