**Railway line intervention**.

Have you seen this city - the city of Bombay? It is a straight line from South to North. A line connected by one railway line or to be more precise three railway lines. Every day millions flock to work and back home on the three straight lines. There is a thing about habits.

If you want to shape a completely new you then all you will have to do is to change one habit that you currently have. You will have to override that habit with a new one. If you can hold on to this new habit for a period of merely 21 days, then without realizing you will stick to the new habit or variation of it. When I say variation I don't mean a slight change. What I mean is that if you start being okay about getting up late in the morning then you will also start being ok about getting late with everything in your life.

So now if you want to change this entire city. Do you know how would you do that? It is a very simple thing to do. All you need to do is to take that railway line and make a small change in what people do in that area. For example, if you want people to be clean and health-conscious along with a lot of other things that are related to hygiene, then you should give their ticket vendor a thermometer.

Now because of this one person in their life who is checking their temperature whenever they go to buy a ticket from the ticket vendor, they will be conscious about thoughts that come along with that temperature reading. The thoughts of being more careful about not having a fever when they are going to buy a ticket. This simple requirement will need them to have thoughts of being more careful about their health. These are further spilled over with them having the thoughts of being more careful about their hygiene.
