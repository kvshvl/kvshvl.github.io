**Erotica 3**.

So it's an early morning. You wake up on bed and turned to hug me but find yourself alone on bed wearing just your underwear and bare body. You rush out of the bedroom to find me. And your eyes stops at the sight of me in the kitchen. Wearing your long sleeved white shirt from the last night.

Buttons randomly done exposing my bra strap on one side of my shoulder my hairs tied out in a messy pony tail. And I'm busy mixing something in bowl. And earphones in my ears. Moving on the beats and enjoying cooking. Couldn't hear you calling out for me.

So I walk to you, you hear me come, but you pretend to not have noticed me. I get close, real close, nibble your ear, and let my hard-on touch your ass. You smile and continue with the mixing. I slowly undo your shirt off your shoulder, and bite the bra strap. Slide my hand under the shirt on your back and hold your waist tightly.

I can feel your hair smell of shampoo, like a fresh woman for me to eat. I spank your ass, and turn you around. You slide the bowl away from us on the counter, and you sit on the top. So I pull your bra strap, and let it snap back to hit you. You jolt, and let me kiss you.

I press my lips against yours, rubbing it there for a second. Then slowly nibble your lower lip, till you draw your tongue out to enter my mouth. I bite your lip, and you gasp. I enjoy how both my hands are now inching slowly up your waist to your back. And running up your spine, to your neck and hold your neck to kiss you harder.

I could feel warm of your body as you coming closer. My hearts biting faster and anxious at the same time to feel your touch on my skin. As you nibble on my ears. I feel a shiver run across my skin and between my legs. I feel my knees going weak with the way you bite my bra strap.

Making my panties wet. And right when you grabed my waist damn I literally lost my breath. Finally catching my breath and trying to make it sound normal. I uttered in a low voice, "Umm! Ah! You are up so early?"
I pause for a second, slide my arms behind you, look for the hook, to undo it again. I slide it off your shoulder, and down your arms, gently caressing them, till the bra falls apart.

I pull your shirt away, as you gasp, "Oh! it will tear." So I cup your left tit in my palm, and touch the tip of my tongue to it. You run a chill down your spine. Hold my head clenching my hair for a while. So I move back, and slide down a finger, that tugs at your wet panties, and pull them away like I own you now.

I spread your legs slightly apart, and then go I down.
