**Open the skies**.

Open the skies,  
and see,  
how we can never be,  
a part of a planet,  
not one of these startups or me.

If we see the way we live,  
there is not much we can do,  
about what starts,  
from technology.

When we climb the sea,   
wonâ€™t we be swimming,  
like swans,  
and fleas,  
or have mystery.
