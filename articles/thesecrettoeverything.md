**The secret to everything**.

Ok, cool! It looks like even if you have a plan: 'you actually don't need a plan, you only need to make one choice at a time', and that's good then because this is a simpler way to deal with stuff.

I sleep on some nights. I am learning how to live a focused life. So I distance myself from the rest of the world, and spend time trying to create things or refining my plans. Since yesterday i have aimed at not making plans. Instead making one move at a time, because life is like chess, and you can get to be wherever you want in 36500 moves, that's 100 years; or 36526 moves if you count leap years.
