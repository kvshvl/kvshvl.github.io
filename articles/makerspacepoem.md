**Makerspace quotes**.

Experience,
Sprung from pain,
to change or gain,
with a will to see,
a new awakening.

Inspiration,
Inspired making,
to see a ray shining.

Ideation,
Lost in thoughts,
or thoughtful actions,
the ideas shall come in,
slow, and swarming.

Make,
To create a piece,
on your own,
learn by making,
and other such pangs.

Prototype,
Make a piece or pick any number,
make as many as you might;
â€˜coz the more you fail, the closer you get,
to the one you like.

Test,
Test your piece,
and behold the joy,
that only a maker can have,
amongst humanity.
