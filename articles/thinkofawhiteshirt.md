**Think of a white shirt**.

Think of a white shirt,
Fluttering in the wind;
As the fabric jitters,
In sunny chills.

Think of a white shirt,
On deep brown soil;
With blue waters shimmering,
Under a summer sky.

Think of a white shirt,
As seagulls cry;
Echoes of human voices,
On a jetty, or a yacht!

Think of a white shirt,
Polo or not;
As crickets dot the evening,
For those binocular eyes.

Think of a white shirt,
For a silent breathe you wait;
Watch your hearts soar,
As the birds take flight.
