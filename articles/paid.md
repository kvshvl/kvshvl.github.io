**Paid**.

This year I got paid for; Airbnb, Architecture, Art, Bookmaking, Clothing, Data curation, Film making, Furniture, Manufacturing, Photography, Songwriting, Startups, Vocals, and WikiHouses. So, dabble in things, that might make sense to your innate being. Don’t bother about what the world thinks, because everytime I told them say, that I was doing this new thing, they had their own version of criticism or marketing. So trust your heart blindly, and teach your brain to do so. Because the brain is a database you see, that’s trained to get you the correct answer on its first thought, which again always comes from the heart. All the best, and have faith.
