**A constant medium**.

If you are used to change the medium of publishing in your creative process then you should stop that. Like the mistake I make is to flip from using speech-to-text vs. typing on other projects. If I want to generate good ideas than writing yourself still cuts the mustard by being the best way to get a continuous flow of ideas. Because when you stop speaking, your brain goes about doing something else. Whereas if you are thinking while writing then your brain will be stuck in a loop giving you ideas because you won't change its general sense of direction. Change of work is often considered as a form of break. I know it's hard to believe that. But it is also the most productive ways to create using a different forms of media. As long as your aim dictates that you can slack in your creative process.
