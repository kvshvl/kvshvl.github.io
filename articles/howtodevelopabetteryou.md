**How to develop a better you?**

Ok, so the thing is that I don't know exactly what I am doing. But I am trying to use the LiveTranscribe application. I have been working without my laptop. I have been out of the house for the past 50 days. It is hectic to type everything using my phone keyboard.

This phone that I am using has a small keyboard. It does not do justice to my flow of thoughts. I intend to record voice notes, minute by minute. So that I can copy them to my Google Keep. I hope to create a collection of notes that I can upload to Typewrighter.

It will become a book someday. I am trying to skip the process of editing by choosing my words carefully while taking these voice notes down. This effort will also help me develop a clearer line of thought with practice. So what you are reading now is actually spoken word dumped onto paper. This is an experimental process.

I intend to develop an efficient way of creating articles. Instead of thinking of a topic and then spending time to create articles around it, I find it easier to blabber voice notes and then pick the things from the rant that can be published. It's very hard to talk about certain things. This is kind of going to be more like a ramble but I like this App. The only trouble is to zone out.

It's so easy to zone out when you like thinking about things in your mind and when you try to talk about it. It is very hard to come up with the same thoughts with the same intensity and the same imagination and creativity. That it is kind of very I don't know what to say but it's been trying very hard to do this and it's not as effective. It's not as if I  thought of the whole idea of this can't be learned. I think everything can be learned.

The difficulty of how hard things are is in the fact that the only difficult part lies in not trying. The initial idea was to document everything that is for body enough to be documented, but now I think it is better to rant instead of anything else. Now the idea is to set a 40 minutes timer on a Pomodoro app. If everything goes well then I will be able to probably collect enough ideas within that timeframe. Ideas that are good enough to post on Typewrighter or something.

This strategy has one problem. I have to edit the transcript a lot. That is hard for me as a process. Firstly because I am lazy. Secondly, because of the time it consumes.

I will try to refine this process. I will keep making new articles here to keep you guys posted. One of ways I had tried was to speak out short sentences. The precision of LiveTranscribe is better in this. In this way, I don't have to edit a lot.

I am unaware of what is the minimum word count required on Typewrighter. Besides most of the articles that you post on to Typewrighter gets rejected because of unspecified reasons. They do say that it can be anything from grammar, plagiarism, quality of content, or wordcount. Their lack of specifics makes it harder for me as a writer to understand what exactly is lacking in my art. This hinders my self-growth as an artist.

I am not sure if this article can make sense to you but I am trying to do somethings differently. I am unaware if this idea of speech to text is a good idea, but I am trying to make a collection of articles from this. It is also a good way to help create a neat nice flow of thoughts. A skill that can come handy if you want to give an impromptu speech or record a podcast! Aha! For the lack of content, I soundboard to myself.

I say my thoughts out loud. Basically talking to myself. Kind of crazy but it works in creating ideas quickly. Everything can then happen because of this. I know I will have to edit these articles but the writing happens as a byproduct of say a kind of speech therapy.

Well yeah, that's it. So wish me luck. I'll see how much of talking can one document hold. I'll also see how many hours can I keep talking in one go. The best thing to do right now is to not spend money on education in India.

Instead write books on everything I know, while doing an online degree from Harvard's. Then use this degree and my books to give guest lectures globally. The most important thing to remember is to keep at it. Most things progress slowly in exigency situations. Not quitting is the key.

You should not waste your time because you have something unique about yourself. Even if you can't see it at this moment. Because very few of us can manage to resolve situations all by themselves. You have to be strong by nature in that perspective. So, you should not catch yourself doing something that you are not excited about.

More than anything else, I think it is important for you to remember all the time that no matter how distraught the whole situation is - no matter how much you might want to blame everything around you - you must aspire to be like the guys who could take a robbery designed to go down under the cover of darkness and pull it off in broad fucking daylight. Your destiny is to develop your sense of strength and power. No one should tell you what to do, stand in your way, or control the terms of your life. It's important for you to create your own rules. Even if you don't relate to your intensity, you're meant to prioritize your own experience and be driven by your passions.
