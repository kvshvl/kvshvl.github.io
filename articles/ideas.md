**Ideas**.

Never found that everytime I get my Idea or everytime you come across an idea you will often think that you had thought about it sometime back in your life. But since you never picked it up or run with it, you were not the one who made it happen. Ideas come and go and they happen to find us in our life just like a dream becomes a reality. Now someone else might be the reason why we see them in our reality. It might be somebody else's effort.

It might be somebody else's money. It might be your brainchild. But it is not yours alone. So next time you feel that why were you not the person to make something happen, or the next time you feel that oh! shit I had thought about this first. So remember this, next time an idea comes to you, forget everything else and try it out.
