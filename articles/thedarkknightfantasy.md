**The Dark Knight fantasy**.

This week I got asked a couple of times by the folks at UN, and a few other friends. A pretty simple question. And note that the mere appearance of the question does not make it simple.

“Why do you support Trump?”

I never followed his speeches. I never knew his history, and I don’t watch the news except when UN Wire requires.

Honestly I know as little about Trump as I know about your dinner last night. No clue. But I blinked. The way Malcolm Gladwell puts it. I saw a millisecond snippet of Trump somewhere, saying “He does not want war.” And to me that was enough. Everybody is at war. Americans being the best at it. Not at war games, but at making war. And when a man stands up to say that he will do exactly what his country is not known for doing right. I will stand by him.

Donald Trump has strange ways. He might be the biggest loser. For none of what will follows from today will help him win on the inside. He has angered a part of his countrymen to overpower him, even before getting to power.

While we all sit here, and wonder how comic American news gets as days pass by. He is working. He is not working on fighting other countries. That means no more conflicts, no more climate change from conflicts, and vice versa. Resources for Africans, and no more trouble for UN Wire.

“You know what he is working on? “

He is working on the inside. He is working at cleaning up. He is being a janitor. He has always been a janitor. And trust the sense of business that says,

“Those who make money are not the ones with the best product out there. Rather the ones who are willing to do what others will not. The ones who are industrious while others wish to be lazy. And the ones who charge for industry.”

Donald Trump must be Bruce Wayne, when it comes to the resources at hand. In my opinion, this chap must love Batman. Not for the glamour or the resemblance. But for those lines Commissioner Gordon said to Foley.

“No help will come from outside… A city must rise on it’s own.”

Donald scaled this thought to his whole country. Both his grandparents are German, Mother’s from Scotland. Boy oh boy! He is a trained perfectionist with all that scottish resourcefulness. And with military discipline he picked up at his army school to go along with it. He’s an introvert, and relentless. No matter what we say, he is a republican with democratic ideals, and followers. He is a nationalist, and he is working on it. Divulging every bit of thought he can scrimmage through the blunders. Every resource he can find to build his country. And that’s a rare mix of self indulgence to be found in the world.

“And I feel it is an Illinois thing…”

Does he not remind you of Robert Moses? Lee Iacocca? President Kennedy? Every time I look at Donald, he looks like those proud Americans from the 70’s. An image of those Republican funded movies, that glance right back from Lee Iacocca’s books on the automobile industry. Back then Detroit in the state of Illinois was known to be the world headquarters for likes of Henry Ford, and American Motor Companies. These are the same people who went on to build machines like the Ford Mustang. Things we cherish. And they played pride at it’s best. They made money off us. These are the same people who put money into building New York with Robert Moses.

Yes, the shitty piece of urbanism that is New York with all those clover leaf concrete patterns of road slicing the city fabric like a knife in a cake. The New York you celebrate. The New York the New Yorkers secretly hate.

“How? Self funding they call it. Just like Trump’s presidential campaign.For what reasons? National Interest, rather the nationalist’s interests.”

Lee Iacocca from Detroit said the same thing. The Ford Motor Company rivalled against Japanese car manufacturers. All of these people have had the same rivals“ — Japan, and China.”

Even for Donald. Illinois you see. Written all over it, in big black Chevrolets. That’s what they have done, will do, and never stop there. Industries that pollute our world, and ideas that make a big mess of urbanism. See my friend, all causes apart. For us the thing that holds value is the American industry minding their own business. Donald Trump is doing just that. His focus is on cleaning the mess that a long line of predecessors have left behind. Somewhat similar to what the Indian premier is upto. Maybe this is just a thing about the age we live in. Maybe the Chinese can tell you the whys, with this monkey year they figured. And in all this thoroughfare, they will forget about us, and they will rise up to their own little bubble.

“And with all pride cometh the fall.”

As history has shown us, just like Ford, Moses, and the rest of them. They shall crumble. So don’t you fret. I am support my country. And it took a lot of a time to get here.

**Tuesday, November 8, US Presidential Election 2016**.

Creativity is to be played on a mind map, not a time map. Deliberation is not the means to achieve most of what life offers. I want to publish everything I have that helps others be better at what they do. Thinking of it I might be reliving the same mistake of trying to get people to get better — to help them help themselves gets me nowhere. I should leave that to Anthony Robbins. I remember when I was learning to ride. I was kickstarting the Vespa, and then I found myself doing the whole exercise for what felt like 5 full mins. My dad said this —

“Just do it, you are thinking too much.”

It did not take half a kick to start that scooter after listening to that. I need to empty my mind. Most of this list making, and following up we do is the best example of how humans have continued to live in the past. There is some addiction to linger ourselves in that space, and analytics — Why don’t we ban the word from our vocabulary? There is no apparent reason to make a list, take a picture, for creating more physical waste to harness our nostalgia. I can take this idea to the extent that if fully applied, the planet will need no more saving. Live in the present. Use bookmarks. So that when you return to things — this means everything from actual bookmarks to the ones on your browser — you will rediscover from your past. I swear don’t you go on adding my Medium posts on your Keep for reading later. Bookmark, don’t collect. Humans have been hoarding things since times immemorial. This is you. This is your free planet. Now imagine this on a globe. If there is something you really need, you know where to find it. You need to live light. Not just travel light. Some pun clarity.

There is no point taking coconuts to Jaipur from Kerala because you think you may not find them there. You just need to look for it. I am sure Malayalees are everywhere.

Malayalees are humans. So humans are everywhere. You will find things for your survival wherever you go. Unless you are Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton. You might complain about the time, and money you have to spend on travel if you don’t carry your turtle pack. But trust me, you use the things from your dearest turtle pack because you have those things around.

Let me ask you a question. How many times have you borrowed a laptop or an iPod or an iPad or anything else that you might carry in your turtle pack from some random stranger on the street? Have you ever? Hmm… Really? So now you know, you can leave the house with just the keys, if you need to get back in. Most of the times, there will be someone to open the door, right? or if you are living alone you can hide it under the pots. Although I will not recommend pot.

If you think I am crazy, and everything else is so much important, everything else on your list is either a distraction, an addiction, or term it whatever you may — everything else is a space changer — excuses for our mind to distract ourselves. All of these things help you focus. You will not burden yourself with things you don’t need, which means Dhan Te Nan! — Room for more experiences — Te Na Nana! What did you learn from the previous sentence? When you begin something, finish it. Beginning things you really do not want to finish are half the reasons of sorrow, and anxiety in your lives. Similarly, do not finish something because you had begun them. May it be a shitty book, a bad relationship, or your bank account. I would suggest close the bank account, and try something you can manage. The focus of all life should be long term happiness. Not spending time on activity speculating or hoping that things will get better. Hope is by the way a loser’s word. Action. Not thought. Ultimately matters. I know The Secret defers — but has anyone seen The Minority Report? There is a quote that stuck in my mind from Leonardo DiCaprio’s latest production on climate change “Before The Flood.”

“The politicians sway to public opinion.”

To me, this not only means that we can now control the politicians, but also that this idea applies everywhere. If I leave the house with only the keys, I will stop using half of my resources. That means my impact flows to consumption, oh those stupid adverts — I cannot imagine someone wakes up every morning to make the media crap on Indian television — marketing, production, and even the raw material. Imagine the farmer lives you could save if you only carry your keys. For you, this is a conscious decision. You will have to make it.

You know why? My happiness is not betting Biryani on who will be next U.S presidential candidate with my guests. It is not talking about on how Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or gay rights or feminism or the next Flipkart Big Billion Sale matters. My happiness is simple. My happiness lies in keeping the planet alive so that your children can make better talks.

**Tuesday, November 8, US Presidential Election 2016**.

My dear Americans,

While I lay here emptying my fridge because my country chose to make an economic shift, pondering for years maybe but an all in one night for us, Just like those surprise tests you guys love — appalled at the way your past is still trending on Twitter. It may be what you did not choose for. Knowing fully well that choosing the lesser evil is often a sad day. And please don’t weigh the opinion of 1 country against the troubles of the world. And the collective world is in the moment very real.

But there are a few things you could feel bright about:

Everything I write about here is hard, just as every thing in life is. Obama is still in power. Trump-age, and stampede is some months away. Working yourself up on social media, and the world with these juvenile antics will do no good to anyone.

Especially not yourself. Let FOX or whoever you trust spread the news. Tweeting about negative stuff spreads needless fear. Not anything else.

I don’t know how your country work, but collectively you can clean up. Call for a re-vote if you can convince the other sane side for it. Or go the french way. Just say ‘No.’ How to do that? Watch ‘Pink’ for clarity. Or learn from your own history?

> “The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.”  
> Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

To be honest, ignore all of that. Pause. The only thing that will matter is nothing. With the entirety of business, and life coming to a slow pace to a near halt for a few weeks because of what my Prime Minister did. But there is so much chaos here, even on normal day, that panic is not something that will ever start in India. That’s given. We know that this will pass, and so do you. So, I spent my day thinking about what is it that I really want to do all my life? And I found not one answer with a because to it. I want you to know that the things that matter the most are all inside you. — your mind, your body, everything that you cannot control. Not another. — Not another person, not another country, not another reason. Not your guns. — Not your money, not your capability, not your nothing. It is happiness, not worry. So take the time, look inside. I know it’s hard to do that in the face of harder issues.

But slow down a bit, and work on yourself. I pray you will soon see clarity like these lines, not cluttered paragraph at the beginning of this post. If you still feel bothered then imagine that you are the only person on our planet. And yes the way you imagine the planet will give you all your answers.

**Social Shifts In India**.

I am aware of the fact that with the measures taken by the Government to end black money, the commons are suffering by the lot.

**Effects**.

- Sourcing money.

This could be anybody’s everyday story, waiting on their time in a queue. Most people who would use cash regularly, have moved on to online wallet apps like MobiKwik, Paytm, FreeCharge AND PayUmoney to avoid waiting in long queues at the banks. The banks seem to have chosen to violate their terms of service to the customers by keeping 24 hours ATMs shut. Should the banks not need RBI Circulars, and a corresponding change of operating protocol notice to be issued to their customers. Whether I am legally correct or not, the banks fucked up their customer service.

- More cars.

This change has made it necessary for most citizens to start an early day to attend to queues. Small businesses that serve overseas markets will find a change of routine as the early start has shuffled wake-sleep routine. Also commuting is difficult without the availability of cash. Only commuters with a seasons ticket or a prepaid Smart Card can use the Mumbai Suburban Rail Transit System. The other options are Uber or Ola Cabs. The major effect that moving 1.2 billion from a cash heavy parallel economy to a cashless economy is documentation. 1.2 billion people have to sign up into wallet applications when the first worry on most their minds is surviving a season. Advent of wallet applications also bring many email receipts to your inboxes. With 1.2 billion people to serve on routine for such documentation, Google will need to provide for more space soon. And people might demand for free space since they have been shown a way of surviving by spending less due to the deficit of paper currency. The Kaali Peelis, and the auto rickshaws part of the transportation industry might join these taxi companies, or migrate to another kind of trade. Those who cannot afford the migration will be a good customer base for the education industry.

Vocational training, and education will have more demand to enable a smoother transition of the massive unemployment scenario that develops. As we promote intra city motorcar transit, we are polluting collectively as a society.

- Changing diets.

Most small business, restaurants do not have a pay by card system. So the choices we make in the morning have been split in two: coffee or ATM. Most of us cannot buy cigarettes because of the lack of a pay by card system. This might mean lesser sales for ITC in the coming quarters. Probably even a drop in prices of tobacco products, if they choose to not siphon the difference. Either ways, we shall experience a healthier population. Have you observed that for ordering a margherita pizza on Zomato, wallet apps offer to pay you a higher cash back percentage. Being vegetarian is a way to riches. I am unsure if this is intentional or circumstantial, but chances are that people might switch to vegetarianism for reasons of money, if not climate change. This may nullify our collective pollution.

**The Sunshine**.

“Indian services need to go online to push the currency deficit to a paperless economy. There are many benefits of doing the shift, and a need for innovation.

- Finding bigger markets.

The opportunity lies in making applications. Applications that cover our lack of infrastructure required in a cashless economy. We should learn from the ways vegetable vendors run their businesses in these tough times. An app for vendors would make life easier for everyone. Facebook will make sense in this context. To give you clarity with a set of prospective areas, think farmers, tourists, chaiwalas, tapris, auto rickshaw drivers, trains, and the rest of us who love filter coffee everyday. Think of everyone we have never met, and those of use without a bank account. These are markets right here.

- Support the tourists.

Opportunity lies in making life easier for travellers. Wallet apps in India do not let you sign up using any mobile number with a foreign country code. Wallet apps do not allow use of foreign bank accounts too. If you are a foreign national living on forex money in India, you are pretty much screwed because of the deficit. Opportunity lies in serving people stuck in these circumstances. One way is to assign an Indian SIM card, and loan money to their wallets. There lies a business idea right here.

- Save on taxes.

Wallet apps do not require you to own a bank account, this means that you can accept payments into any wallet app, and manage life better. Families, and businesses can save a lot of tax by using one bank account, and many wallet app accounts. They could pay their employees via wallet transfers.

Lesser tax filings for the employees. I agree that the government might collect lesser tax in the coming years by giving way to these apps. Looking at the situation from a broader perspective, no more paper, lesser logistical costs will lead to a smaller carbon footprint. That’s more value in it for everyone.

India has forced her citizens to go cashless. You can curse the current Government or take sides with them. But the government has done what most probably is the best thing a government can do to curb climate change. A simple change that make people conscious, and rethink about their habits, what they own, what they use, their behaviours, patterns, et cetera. With a rise in awareness for a cashless economy, the value of the Indian Rupee will soon surpass the US Dollar, the value of the Indian Rupee will equal that of time in the financial capital of India.
