**Background music**.

There is this constant background music that comes to us in life. Most of it is the form of other people talking at us or other things around us that create sound or noise depending on the way you look at it. It is hard to pretend that these things do not bother us at work but the better way of doing things might be to say no. It is okay to ask for space. It is okay to ask for time.

It is okay to be patient. It is okay to slow down. No matter that we try, in this life we should all believe in that story. The story which is probably the first story that you heard about. The story about the tortoise and the hare.

The tortoise wins doesn't he/she? Well that my friends, is true even in life. Like one of my architects used to say, the slower you go, the longer things will last. Her rule applies even in everything. From dating to products. Everywhere.
