**This is us**.

This afternoon we were watching "This is us".  
We were talking about the show after keeping it on pause.  
She probably disagreed something in the discussion.  
So she let my hand go.  
So I tried to hold her hand.  
She pushed me away.  
So I asked her what happened.  
She had told me go shower then she would tell me.  
So I showered.  
After shower, I asked to tell me what happened.  
She did not tell me.  
She went into the bedroom.  
I went to check on her a few minutes later.  
She said she needs space.  
So I went back to the living room.  
Then after a while I went to the bedroom to take pictures of the view outside.  
She was sleeping.  
Then while I was clicking the pictures, she beckoned me to come sleep with her.  
We cuddled, had period sex.  
I hurt her biceps when I accidentally placed my arm on them.  
This is the sex in which she asked me to slap her.  
After sex, she went to guest bathroom to clean up.  
I went to the master bathroom to clean up and take a dump.  
When I came out, she was in the living room.  
She was nursing her biceps.  
I asked to help out.  
She said she will handle it.  
She went to the kitchen.  
She got an ice pack.  
She kept nursing it.  
She went to the kitchen.  
She made dinner ke liye chilaa for herself.  
She asked me stand a feet away from her.  
We had dinner together.  
I told her I was staying at my aunt's place tonight and I will see her later in this week. Also I have to pick up my clothes from her place.  
She asked me for a reason.  
I told her that she had been pushing me away, she wasn't communicating, she had asked for space, and that I don't feel comfortable about these reasons.  
She said she would not change her ways.  
I told her that I needed space.  
So she said I can't put the asking for space bit on her.  
She said I am walking out.  
I left.
