**The who, not the whats?**.

These folks ask me what the key is to building their career is — what’s the next thing they ought to be doing. And I usually frustrate them by answering with questions: What are you passionate about? What sends you springing out of bed in the morning? What is it that brings out the absolute best in you? What is it that inspires you? What do you want to do for the world? What would you do if money was no constraint?

What do you want to be remembered for? What do you want your legacy to be? Think about these questions — the answer to these questions are all about who you are, and may help you discover what you want to be, and what your next step should look like.
