**The key to money**.

Do you know what the key to wealth is?

Like I mentioned in the previous article the key to banking is spending your money in the right places. I am sorry I could not make a build up for this article or the answer. but the whole idea of not hiding things from you and giving it to you ASAP is sort of in my DNA. it is funny how you always think that saving money is the key to having more wealth. But that is not true.

Saving money only leaves you with a lot of money that might have face value but it will not have its place value because inflation is a thing. investing money on the other hand is a defence against it it is more like a hedge like a hedge fund is. so if you invest your money in places where its value keeps increasing for example property, gold, actually not gold, but you get my point. 

Debt funds are also a good place to go but I don't think the markets are safe enough the volatile so I think it is better to have a system of your own in place. So instead of having to go to the banks for money or maybe e trying to invest your money in the existing systems of the markets, I think you will do yourself a favour if you give money or rather spend money in your local economy so that your social structure and your social support system helps you count on the people around you which is more emotional in nature than transactional.

If you build a place for yourself in this world in which every time you have ever on gets spent on the people around you like the local rikshawala the local grocery store and people in your community then you are basically actually creating an emotional network of resources which will come to your help whenever you need to get something done that is key to exigencies.

As and when I had thought that saving money was the ki I was wrong so I might be wrong in this regard to but I know for the fact that money comes to those who spend it in the right places because it might come back for example in the form of returns or in the form of social help or in the form of say products or things that you can use.

Money is nothing but tool to get the things you want and which enables you to do the things you want to do in your life. Now most people look at money as an asset but money by itself is not an asset. It is again a tool that is something I would like you to remember for the rest of your life. It is as good as a saw is to a carpenter or a screwdriver is to an electrician or wrench is to a plumber.
