**Schedule for quick dating**.

Here's a schedule for quick dating that I religiously followed from 2014 to 2016 to be able to blink about people. It helped me meet a variety of people from various walks of life using applications like Airbnb, Aisle, Bumble, Hinge, Facebook, Haikujam, Instagram, Tinder, and Twitter. It was a great learning experience for me.
