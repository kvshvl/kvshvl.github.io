**Content creation for architects**.

I think you are thinking old school where the only way information would flow would be through peer recommendation. This is the internet age. You are as good as your content. Regardless of who thinks what. As long as the content you put out is universally true, you are good enough.

A[1. Make a post,
2. Repeat 1,
3. Repeat 2,
4. Repeat 3, and so on], B[...], C[...], and so on beyond Z[...], AA[...], AB[...], AC[...], and so on.

If you then pick the best of your thoughts between A[...], B[...], C[...], and so on... to compile books A[...], B[...], C[...], and so on... you will have enough for the credibility you are looking for.
