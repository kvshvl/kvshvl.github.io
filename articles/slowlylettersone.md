**Slowly letters 1**.

Hahahahaha, let's write longer letters :P
since these may take days to reach you/me.

Well, those things I did happened over the years, say about 15 years. I am sure a lot of people do many things, but don't write them down in a list like I did. I am sure there is nothing spectacular about it.

Where are you originally from? Where were you born? Or did all did you move to?

My story goes like,
90 Borivali, Bombay
96 Nerul, Navi Mumbai
98 Kudal
08 Belgaum
11 Belgaum, and Bangalore
12 Belgaum
13 Bangalore
14 Seawoods, Navi Mumbai
15 Bandra, Mumbai
16 Andheri East, Mumbai
17 Malad, Goregaon, and Bangalore
18 Bangalore, and Seawoods, Navi Mumbai
19 Seawoods, Navi Mumbai

I used to be in Mumbai for vacations.

üòõ I am not that interesting, it's just that I talk a lot. For example, hold a conversation for 8 hours on first dates. Probably that's why I could take lectures. I once did a photography project of shooting pictures of myself everyday to see how my look changed as my beard grew after a clean-shave to a bear-face. I should upload that on my Instagram.

I live in Seawoods, Navi Mumbai these days. Today, I am at a place called Aarey Milk Colony. I am spending some alone time at a friend's house, who isn't here, who is visiting folks. I will stay here until this friend returns from home on the 2nd of Jan, or until my birthday, 31st of December, I don't know for sure, let's see.

India is a big place. I have travelled to most of the states during my architecture college days, and I have so much left to see. Maybe someday I will travel it all.

I have never travelled abroad. I got my passport 16 days ago. I have always wanted to travel the world and film landscapes enroute. Would you be interested to join the team?

Also, I have been thinking of moving to a different country for a job. Popular options are Canada, Australia, or New Zealand. Argentina was on my mind, but it was a forgotten choice. I can't speak Portuguese, or Spanish as my one Brazilian and another Argentine friend does. I need to practice these. How many languages do you know?

Tell me about yourself. What all do you do in life? Do you teach?
