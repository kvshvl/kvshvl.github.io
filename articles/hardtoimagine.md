**Hard to imagine**.

I was looking at youtube videos on Steve Jobs. Most of them displayed how self appreciation was a key to better marketing. I wonder if anyone else feels that way about Steve. I did some browsing, and reading here on Medium. Lot of good stuff I must say.

It made me think of all the things I should focus on — the businesses, the next step, the blah blah, and the needs to get done, period. I wondered if at all I had to begin that list from it’s end, I will get to a point where the rest of the list becomes invalid. I believe that what needs to be done is something we all can imagine. Rather it gets done because we can imagine it. Ain’t that easy, human?
