**I met someone**.

“You will meet her in seven days,
her name starts with N,
it has eight alphabets,
you will meet at the place you sang,
but hang on a sec,
don’t kiss her yet,
or you might lose her forever again.”

"Someone told me that,
nearly 10 years ago,
on an online crazy chat streak,
as crazy as this weekend was until now."

"So close to reality,
so hard to believe,
what someone saw in my past,
was my future behold! This week."

"I have never followed occult,
for all its mystery,
it has always been,
a double check for me.

She wants to be an conceptual artist,
and explore her beliefs,
in time travel, and philosophy,
while she is a soul to die for, indeed."

"When I look back on my life now,
connecting these dots seem so obvious to me,
everything fits so lovely,
even every silly thing I reaped.

Life could not have taught me better,
through sadness, and ease,
what joy was there to sit by her,
that the moment felt like eternity."

"I might sound so patronizing,
so head over heels,
being used to empty dinner tables,
and empty cafes it seems."

"I love to be outdoors,
away from those haunting patterns, and fear,
but with her this was different,
no odd design could bother me."

"I have never felt so careless,
I have never felt so free,
the design never did haunt me,
honestly."

"Mad over donuts,
and sweet chariot maybe,
have never been my options,
for dates or dining out,
lately."

"I was shivering from the cold,
so she sat me down on a bench,
and shared her love for purple,
oh baigan you see!"

"I wore that jacket to walks,
from cafes to streets,
swaggin’ around town,
while blind she be of me."

"My friends,
oh cry! they will, “the man ain’t my friend”,
for traveling to meet her,
to dine in maybe,
deny they know me."

"For such a beauty is my lady,
beyond the strokes of my pencil,
cannot capture her in sharp portraits,
or anatomy."

"Yet she echoes through my soul,
like magic in her fingertips,
like the poetry in thee,
coz’ yes, we did not kiss."
