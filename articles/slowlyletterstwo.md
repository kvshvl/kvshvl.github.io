**Slowly letters 2**.

Corinthiana, that's such an architect-y name na. :P Where did you do your architecture from - as in which college?

I loved Slowly but after a while, since we are like 2 hours away by flight, this will feel like intermittent texting :D Also there is none of the post office being shut, none of the visiting the stationery store for envelopes, and none of the figuring out of how many postal stamps do you need to paste on the letters, plus the argument with the postmaster on how much postage they should charge and jazz. Yes! I have had many penpals back in the day. I have all their addresses committed to memory :P I am being such a boastful ass now.

Write anonymously. I don't care. But knowing your first name is preferred. Maybe someday I will find you in some architecture event. Maybe someday I can do something with that. :P

I am on slowly because I work solo. I get bored often so talking to people helps. Also, all these questions that people ask give me a point of reference for myself. It's kind of a reality check and self-discovery. This is also the reason I am anywhere I get to talk to people, like dating apps and jazz. I wrote the bio from my website because I was too lazy to type out a new bio for Slowly :P

I like being in new places, and you can always revisit the old ones. Newness, and nostalgia have their own charms. I often do this thing of pausing everything, gazing into the horizon, and burning that moment to my memory. This is probably something that I have never told anyone. Where all have you lived exactly?

Are you an art teacher? :P 
At times, I write not-subtle-at-all erotica.  ðŸ™ˆ 
Just playful tease :P nothing more. I love keeping things on edge on somedays.

And no! My fetish did not inspire me to be an architect. The things that inspired me to be an architect was my love for doing everything. I used to make small airplanes at 13, make models of stuff, sell refills on the streets after school, not because the family was poor or anything like that, but just because I loved it all. I am a generalist, not a specialist :P something like that.

I am thinking of moving. I want to move because I want to travel the world. Roadtrip the world, and film the whole trip on camera. Not marry anyone and travel! I think this also answers your last question :P This life dream requires a lot of self-funding that the Indian economy does not give me. For now, I just got my passport na, so I am reading up on the matter. Bangalore, Canada, Eastern Europe, and France are on my mind.

Work license is not an issue in most countries. Also, you cannot afford to run an architectural business without a local partner. I collected these local partners when I was in the 2nd year of my college. So right now, it is a lot easier for me to move to any country that lets me employ myself as an architect, with them, or under them. On the other hand, I can always work in a firm without having any contacts.

You do know a lot of languages. I can speak let me recount - English, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, Spanish (6). Dialects - Malvani, Hyderabadi Hindi (2). Beginner - German, Bosnian, Serbian, Turkish (4)

I think everyone is trying to figure out what to do in life. This is an architecture thing. You should write your thoughts down. Or tell it to someone else without looking for a response, or say it out loud to yourself. I call this as sound boarding. And the person you do this with is your sounding board. More like how the board of directors of a company is. Ideally, make a list (ideally on paper), and ask a simple question, "Do you want to do this?" - then apply this rule - "If the answer is not a clear YES, then it's a clear No!"

Would you like to work together? We could be a lot of fun. In life, I am literally at a point in life where I can do whatever I want to do with no past commitments. Let me know, and maybe we can beat the world at it :P Also, I have got space, if you are open to the idea. Let me know.

I teach architectural design, graphics & drawing representation, and AutoDesk software to students up to the 4th Semester. 

I asked about the single bit because every place is an amazing place to find good platonic love. Unlike dating apps, it's slow-paced, and we get to know each other before anything else. I am not looking to marry. For me, it's travel first with my partner, then buy a piece of land, with a lot of dogs, basically having a kennel.

Also, I _might_ ask you out someday, or I _might not_ ask you out at all, we never know. There are no expectations. I like your bio. I am going to try and reply to your letter now :P

- What is your birthdate?

- What all are you curious about in life?

- Tell me about your favorite architectural structures. - Bridges, I love bridges. The ones like Erasmus in 
Rotterdam, Netherlands.

- I love listening to any kind of music but metal. As for songs, the lyrics should have a good story in it. I would like to read books, but then I realized that the movie covers that same story in 3 hours or so. So that's lucrative :P  I love playing minesweeper. Now I am your favorite person :P

- What are you currently reading? What's your favorite book? Do you have a reading list? I love reading.

- Do you have an Instagram page or something for your photography? I love Instagramming. Remind me to share this after we know each other really well. For now, I will live in suspense :P I like people who hate selfies :D The beard and face project was an exception :D

- I love being by myself. I try sketching on tissue paper at restaurants. I do all my site work on sketches, and you are exhilarating. I never got access to Korean shows. Help me out there!? I love walking, and I have only once heard someone use the word Southpaw before. Gosh, you must be sculpted as fuck. I really need to hit the gym too :P 

- P.S: All kinds of a gym, to sharpen me overall :D

Gosh! I did write a long letter. Let's see if you can reply to this one and not get bored doing so :P Sorry typing to all of this is going to take a while. ðŸ™ˆ I am not asking you a new question at the end of this letter because duh! :P :D

Yours truly,
