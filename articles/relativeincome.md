**Relative income**.

What are we posting here?

Here's what posting written content here means.

People will rate your posts with cursors. You can cash out your collection of cursors to paytm wallet. You also get cursors for reading and rating other people's post.

Factis 1 user can give you 10 cursors max for 1 post.

Suppose there are 100,000 users.

Soevery post can get you 1,000,000 cursors over life with these margins.

Suppose 10 cursors gives Re.1.

So 1,000,000 cursors can give you Rs. 100,000 over your lifetime.

Fact is if you keep posting, make a collection of posts, keep the account active, and participate - then this process will pay out a considerable sum of money to your Paytm wallet.

Why is this beneficial?

I was once offered in job that paid me 100 thousand rupees a month. To be honest it looks like a fair deal. But what I think is not good about getting paid so much is the time that I invest in it. Every month salary is given for the work that you do in that month. You will never get paid for the work that you have done in that month ever again in your entire life. But the work that I do by writing these articles and by sharing my own thoughts and insights with all my readers here in this month will keeping me for the next month and the month after that and so on until this app exist. If you look at this entire process in this way then it is only a matter of time before you start earning more from Typewrighter than the highest paid employee in your current company.

How does this matter?

When you compare things in life people often forget that life is made not out of money but out of time. Take a seconds pause observe everything that is happening around you. This moment that you spent observing things around you is time.

Relative income is measured along the idea of time. If you make 30,000 a month then you are making 1000 in a day. Suppose I make the same amount of money in a day.

But now when you factor in time we realise that you have spent 10 hours in your day making 1000 rupees. If I put 10 hours in my day on Typewrighter and make 1000 rupees for that day then we are equals. But remember I told you I will get paid again and again for the work I have done in one day here.

So you may not get paid 1000 rupees for today again in your life, but I will. This only means that I am now making more than 1000 rupees for 10 hours of my time. This is how my income becomes more than yours even if we are equals in effort.
