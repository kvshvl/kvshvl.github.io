**Portraits**.

So I have always been thinking about making a blog for the way my hair grows back. Self shot portraits, day after day, documenting how my look changes to an extent that I get stopped at ID checks because the photo doesnâ€™t look anything like me. I have had my doubts on how the world would take it. The judgements passed, and why am I doing this. As if my inner self criticized me for validation of some sort.

But then again the whole process shall free me of my qualms and queries. It will make me free as I throw an vulnerable side of me into debate on purpose. The swarm of people that I come into contact with on social media, and then that knowledge being a reminder that public opinion does not matter. Fit me as I am. Take me as I am.

For I have years of experience walking into difficult situations knowingly. The idea that I have to prove something will vanish. And I will be freed of all self doubt that sets in when I am questioned for my radical uncommon actions, or behaviours. The self awareness that this brings is more important as an asset to have than any other life experience can bring. This blog is @madewithadobe.
