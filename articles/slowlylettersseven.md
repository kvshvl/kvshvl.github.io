**Slowly letters 7**.

Yes. My parent's marriage is one of a kind. Maharashtrian guy, Malayalee girl. Guy's from a patriarchal society. Girl's from a matriarchal society. Guy's a capitalist. Girl's a communist. Guy's family is religious. Girl's family is not religious. I was born in the city. I grew up in places where the streets had no names. Such a mix! I feel like I have seen the best and worst of all worlds.

It wasn't a big deal back then, somewhere in the 80s considering that they belong to families that have owned banks starting from my great grandfather. I am not fluent in Malayalam. I can survive in a gathering of cousins though :P

I have been to Kerala 4 times in my life. Once with the family when I was a kid to Kannur. Once with my aunt and her family to Kasargod, I think.  Once on a college tour when I passed through Kerala on my way to Bangalore from Kanyakumari. Once with my college roommates on a very impromptu trip to Mananthvadi, Wayanad.

I am not a Bombay boy, definitely not a South Bombay guy. I don't know what I am. I am a mix of different things in this city. For example, you know when you can go from "kidhar hai bey" to "Kasa kay bantai" in less than a second. :P

Childhood was filled with a lot of things. A mix of bullying, fishing on bridges, river rafting, traveling in the countryside, wildlife. I think I can tell you more about instances of being brought by parents from two entirely different cultures if you can ask me a lot of specific questions about it :D

I have heard of Thiruvalla, Pathanamthitta. I am not aware of its geographical location. But isn't that a temple town? Is it in Wayanad? I am not sure but it sounds familiar.

My passion for making small airplane models, fly them in vast open country plains and building things, in general, led me to architecture. I wanted to be an inventor. I still do. I did not know much about architecture when I thought of doing the degree. As it is, Architecture is a small niche of itself. To add to that, I was in a rural area during schooling years. I don't know much about architecture yetI Tell me one thing, why do most women in Psychology join the field after they meet a psychologist? I have heard this "met a psychologist, and was inspired by how he changed people's life" story umpteenth times now :D

This is new information. I always thought that masters were enough for psychologists to practice in India. Never knew an M.Phil is necessary too. Is this specific to clinical psychology only? or is this new rule applied for every branch of psychology?

I think education in India in every field is lagging behind the world in terms of practical exposure. It's a vicious cycle, especially when colleges hire their current graduating batch to teach the next batches. Like why the fuck would you do such disservice to others!

Woman! Most psychologists are always hot and bothered. Too many psychs would make the population rate spike! Are you sure you still want to increase the capacity of those colleges?

So you are in going to be studying in India 2024 at least. I just realized it's 2020 in the next 3 days. Fuck my life, I am growing older! Oh, your mom is a Malayalee in Canada? That's a first! :D hahaha. 

I want to road trip around the world. I need a job that pays me well for it. I will move or not move depending on where it is. If these constraints are waived off then I will probably think of Canada or maybe France. Have you seen the streets in Paris? They are ❤️. 

If not Canada, then what's on your mind now?

Whenever you make a to-do list, keep the clock away. 
And when you are doing something, don't pause, or stop, or take a break, until it's done. 

I am aware that this process will get tiring, so you have to make the to-do list as detailed as possible, include all the steps in it. When you get tired, work on a different step. We often don't realize but - A change of job is also a break/ relaxation.

This is also the answer to your earlier question of how did I manage to do so much more in life at my age.

I need a travel partner. period. For company, intimacy, and sex. Not always though. But then if I leave her/you alone I am bound to have trust issues in the first few months of being together, then things normalize.

It's funny how most people go on these solo trips, and realize that they are not happy with their lives, and weird enough everyone goes on an "ending things, ending relationships, quitting jobs, getting a haircut, ending epithelial life (tattoo :P)  spiral" instead of a "fixing things spiral". Like I haven't found anyone who would come back from a journey and want to continue their life as it is. Such people must be rare.

So you have traveled this country in the "I went to work in Switzerland but the Alps were always behind that glass window" sort. :P

If you want to add me/ message me/ or whatever on Instagram, do let me know it's you, and then when I follow you back, accept my request. Else I will think that you are just another cute married girl trying to lead a double life :D :P

I am researching on the programming of human behavior using architecture. I use this a lot in my architectural work. Mostly because they are all event spaces. That means places that are dilapidated when I and my client go there. Then I measure it, sketch it, discuss the options my clients will have if he gets that place on a lease, then I draw it, make a model, discuss some more by looking at the model and then I give my client the final drawings to begin the work by the end of the day. I guess writing and drawing architectural solutions is the only thing that I am pretty fast at. I need to capitalize on this. :D

Question for today: Do you make/ build or curate stuff?

Yours truly, 

P.S.: :P I am thinking of publishing these letters into a book format.
