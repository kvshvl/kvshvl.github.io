**Roads**.

So what happens when people are friendly, almost to the extend that they feel like a soulmate. But when they return from their travels things appear different. They have this exterior grim face that appears unwarranted for. When we happen to declutter, a lot. We realize that greatest joy is in our work, not in solitude, not in human companionship or human deeds, nor in our travels, and dreams.

I have found that travel has become a way of life for most of us. At least a way of life to aspire for. But there is one thing about all of the hype that strikes me odd. You will understand why I call it a hype, hopefully by the time we get to the end of this post. I have met many people who have travelled to almost all of the continents before they hit their 20s.

Now, since I was raised on a farm, my initial train of thought was to believe that since these people travel, they would have an exposure that makes them mature enough to know, and understand the meaning of life. At least shouldn’t that be the case? But I find these people despising a road side tea seller, for the reason that he is selling tea by the wayside. They seem to be oblivious to the fact that that is a man trying to be an honest living. I find these people complaining about traffic, about the events that happen in their lives, and about the place that they are at. After having met just about enough some 20 odd year olds, I realised why did all the traveling their parents paid for did not help them with any sense of empathy.

And the reasons are pretty simple: Their parents paid for most of it. They lived at places comfortable enough for a family to be at, which goes to say, they have always been exposed to the bright side of our civilisation. They have not seen real pain, real hunger, real emotions with no motive or gain. They have travelled, yes. But they have seen not.

They have seen the tourist places, and all the hot spots. They have seen the temples, and culture, but not the poverty, the slums, and the rot. They have been inside the comforts of a vehicle, and not on foot on a sidewalk, or stranded alone at a deserted station with not a known soul in the place they have been, nor have they seen the efforts made to survive a journey without the luxuries of a human hand to help them out. I remember once a friend quoting, “The roads they gave us a lot, but they also took a lot from us.” I never knew what she meant, until this day.

Just a gist of it, that my mind plays with, is what I have seen, and learnt from all these travel craving people around me.
