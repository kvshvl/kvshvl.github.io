**Erotica 13**.

She: So what's ur move? To get started in bed? Because with the way you speak, I know you have not one but a few moves that you start with.

He: I will start with your neck. Please don't turn me on right now. I am already all hot and bothered. I want to hold you. In a surprise, from your back. Kiss your neck, and bite it. Mark my territory, and slide my fingers done your waist. Keep them there, and bite your ears. Slowly watching you bite your lips. How about you?

She: I don't have a move. :P But I do. Well I would usually start by taking a sit with my legs around your waist kissing you slowly, and then deepen the kiss. Maybe softly bite the lip, and then pull your head back with my hand in your hair trailing kisses till your ear. Lick your earlobe and softly whisper... do you know what you have to do next? Or will I have to tell you?

He: You are fucking me. Because you won't survive the way I will toss you and throw you around in bed. This kind of teasing is making me want you. I am going to run my fingers all over you. Not ripping your clothes like I usually would. But peel layers of it, off you... Slowly. As slowly as time can run, while kissing you slowly. Actually, not a kiss but a peck. Only rubbing my lips on yours, then a nibble. A slow kiss on your upper lip. Stop. Freeze there, holding your lips in mine as my hands continue to undress you.

Yes. Un-dress you. Not torture nor punish nor tear you into bare nakedness. And let this silence of waiting for my next move eat away your patience. Then I slide my tongue to touch yours. Deep slow kisses. While my fingers are playing a symphony on your back. Running across it, in the most slow soft manner. Then run my tongue down your neck, collar bones, chest, boobs, and waist then whisper... Do you know where I am headed? Or do you want to lead?

She: Well if that happens I would pull you with your collar to the bed, push all of you in and show you how leading is not something you should be thinking about with me, unless I tell you to.

He: Then I will pull myself out and put my tulips on your organ to eat you out before you can blink.

She: Okay now you are turning me on which is not a good sign.

He: Well, I am going to make sure that you get addicted to me.
