**Shift**.

Why is there an apparent hurry in the shift for the Rupee?

With over a population of 1.2 Billion people, the news seems to be reaching people after working hours of the banks. This change which will come into effect post midnight seems suspicious. The idea of applying a change in accepted larger denominations of the Rupee will hit the poor, and the farmers of the country hard. After a week down, the atms are not yet fully operational. Why wouldn’t the government print notes in advance to ease the shift? Why wouldn’t the banks be running overnight if they had to pump the economy back to the previous normal?

For a land of villages, the shift should have been careful, and considerate of all the citizens for the world’s largest democracy.
