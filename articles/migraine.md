**Migraine**.

She said she wanted to make love, but not while we worked hither, nor this or that, nor here or there. She had another hundred clauses to spare, I wish her life was simple still, for now she is stuck between blowing horns, not the pace she wished for today, for the traffic made her miss her gig. Now she has to apply again, though this is happening for the third time, yet she blames me for her migraine, I wish she wasnâ€™t stuck in there.
