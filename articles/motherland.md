**Motherland**.

There is no sense in me, I wonder if you can feel, subtle substance in these, lyrics they call, in these songs that we cannot sing, if we could only hear the music, we wouldnâ€™t need a guitar to please, our motherland. There are no trains to get home, there is just a long wait, for these men to work magic, and let us all reach the things we preach, day on, and day off, until the night screams for peace.
