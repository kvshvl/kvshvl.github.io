**Let me**.

Let me lose myself in you. Behind those knocks on the door and sliding windows. There isnâ€™t a moment I want, without your envelope, the smell of you body, the wetness of your skin, the curves that hold me, under your sheets, from winter nights to summer days, there is barely anything, that I want to not do with you, not want to feel in your company.
