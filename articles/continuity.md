**Continuity**.

To help us go down memory lane, to crave a feeling of nostalgia. Even if as we speak of many memories that buildings evoke. There is nothing more than reflection to be found in those moments. It may be hard to accept as certain spaces evolve, but after all time changes, and things change with it. There are many places that most of us would go back to.

To be in a time space of yesteryears, and to revolve a day or two in continuing those memories. But the fun lies not in reflection, but rather those hard, and fast stories that reality brings down on us. It watching things evolve just as a plant might take root upon the earth. There are so many such stages, that we forget about some until some happenings remind us about those in an instant. Every stage has a reason and those are the links that lead to learning in everything.

Cedric Price might be wrong when he said, “Technology is the answer.” We, humans are guilty. Of spending time doing things that don’t matter. — Technology, social media, checking your phone, ordering food online instead of walking to a cafe where you can meet people so that people don’t crash, carrying anything but your keys, wearing a full sleeve shirt, killing mosquitoes with chemicals, watching videos instead of books, looking down at your phone, eating meals without conversations, drinking water between the meals, blah blah blah. How do you decide if something matters? Try not doing it.

Instead. If we choose to weed out everything we have learnt, own or meet. We will not have decluttered, but discovered ourselves. And experience the world in a new light.

Do you know what the world needs the most?
Questions. A lot of them.
