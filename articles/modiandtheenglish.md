**Modi & the English**.

I always thought that the English were smart people. But after last night's show of The King, I just realized that England is a tiny kingdom who lost a lot of kings and queens in battles trying to expand their kingdom across France. Most of these monarchs never ruled beyond 9 years. This also seems to be the process of trial and error through which the English were able to conceptualize the methods of colonization. The idea of occupying another country and capturing it under the premise of fair trade. So just as the Anglo-French Hundred Year's War was practice grounds for the English. In my understanding, the state of Gujarat has served as a practice ground for Narendra Modi. The traces of everything this tyrant Government of India does henceforth shall be evident in the recent history of Gujarat. Learning from the English history, the roots of this tyranny could lie as far ago as a 100 years. Maybe, more.
