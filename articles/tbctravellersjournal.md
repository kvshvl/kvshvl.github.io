**TBC travellers journal**.

So now this bad boy is called The TBC Travellers Journal. But I made some changes in their original package. Now, with one notebook instead of two, and two pouches instead of one, this handcrafted beauty holds a blank notebook with two permanent bookmarks inside, all my cards, cash, IDs, and passports. I bought 3 unipin pigment ink pens - 0.05mm for those fine lines, 0.2mm for those normal lines, and 0.8mm for some heavy weight sketching. Although, there is a penholder on the side, I hung two of these on an antique metal clip (comes from TBC); ah! That's where my boarding pass goes.

TBC engraved my name on leather to make a custom nametag; you know for those days when you find this arsenal being lost, and have to bring it home? I am never carrying a wallet again. The original TBC package lets you opt for 2 blank/dot grid/ruled notebooks. I think TBC has this in Black, Brown, Tan, Full Yellow Rickshaw, Yellow & Black Rickshaw (this one), Green, Pink & Green, and oh my! This is a midori, a passport holder, and what not! You should check it out! @theblackcanvas_

Remember - Nothing boots as fast as pen and paper.
