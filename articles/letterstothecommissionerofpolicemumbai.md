**Letters to The Commissioner of Police, Mumbai**.

Date: 15th May 2020

Dear Mr. Param Bir Singh,  
Commissioner of Police,  
Mumbai,  
MH. India.  

I am Kushal Dhananjay Samant. I am a resident at the following address as per my passport records: 6/A2, Shree Hari CHS, Plot-11, Behind Neurogen Hospital, Sector 40, Seawoods (W), Navi Mumbai — 400706. MH. INDIA. I am a stranded individual at the following address at the moment: C/o Satchit Puranik, Flat №14, Tabeer Terrace CHS, Lane Opposite Orchid Global Learning Academy, Versova, Andheri (W), Mumbai — 400061. MH. INDIA. My apologies because I was unaware of the changes in the online application process that were being carried out by Maharashtra Police when I was preparing the following documents for my Travel Pass application as a stranded individual as per the previous form that was available on the website — <a href="https://covid19.mhpolice.in" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">covid19.mhpolice.in</a>. I have followed through meticulously on all tests, and documents required for my travel back home. I am sending these documents for your reference along with this letter.

1. A prescription from Dr. Vernon Miranda to get a COVID19 test done, solely for travel purposes.

2. COVID19 test report from Suburban Diagnostics. My test report says, “SARS-CoV-2: Not detected.” i.e. COVID19 negative.

3. Fitness Certificate from Dr. Vernon Miranda based on this Test Report.

DN Nagar Police Station has quoted, “They have not received any instructions regarding inter-district transit for stranded individuals”. I have been advised one police officer to take an auto (which is unavailable) or take a private vehicle (which no one is willing to volunteer). This ball is now, apparently in your court. The Mumbai Police website — <a href="https://mumbaipolice.co.in/ApplicationforEmergencyTravelMigrant.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mumbaipolice.co.in/ApplicationforEmergencyTravelMigrant.html</a> now deems it necessary that I should submit an RC Book and a driving license as an individual if I have to return home. Do you think that this is preposterous? Because I imagine it to be so. I would like to request you to kindly grant me either of these permissions.

1. Permission to return home by public bus transport or,

2. A letter that permits any auto driver to return home after dropping me home.

I hope you shall support my return. You can reply to this message or contact me on +918779632310 for any queries.
Thanking you very much.

Yours truly,  
Ar. Kushal Dhananjay Samant.
