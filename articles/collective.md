**Collective**.

Some things in life need a lot more rhythm to it than you can beat. And thatâ€™s okay. So today I went to a movie screening. There were thoughts being shared about collective work in the city. About how the people collectively make a city without any formal inspiration. Now I have a question. If the boundaries are to be dissolved, and the city becomes an ocean of collaboration, where, and how does one creative mind find individuality OR Identity of a creative expression? Does anybody have any thoughts?
