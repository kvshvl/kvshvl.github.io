**Architects, and presentations**.

Coming to think of it, presentations scare me. Architecture has given me the skill set to sell ice to the Eskimos at prices even Jobs would fear to mark up. But that’s just talk. When it comes to doing work to present your projects, and if you are an architect who wants to develop a product for yourself. Please put a deadline before you put the price tag.

I find offhand inspiration at random moments during the year, when I can get more done in a week without having to push myself, while at other times, even an year long of work does not find the same level progress. The thing that I have caught myself doing is putting green tree marks on presentation sheets. Now I would certainly agree with you that you know ho to make those presentations look beautiful. Worth staring at! But have you ever found the amount of repetitive work that architects all over the world do creating the same styles of presentations. They rather be playing with an idea, then Photoshop their lives all along.

Because sometimes focus gets lost. You waver away from developing a product to making things beautiful. If you are not careful, then you may have to start another project to back the first. If you are yet less careful, then you may as well be stuck in a cycle — starting a project to back another one — that’s more like lying to save another lie. Instead, why don’t we worry about action and getting done with things, the simplest of the idea — the basis.

Why do most of us spend night after night plonking green trees on paper when we could be make ourselves more useful by doing. There is actually no need to plan a day — even today. Thinking keeps us thinking. Doing keeps us doing. Anything begets the same thing.

The energies you give into the universe come back to you — magnified. What I am getting at here is that, our focus should be only on the things that we know will make an actual difference as we progress towards our goals. Yes, goals, not dreams. Deciding — ‘decide’ means ‘to cut’ — is really a process of choosing what not to do. This is something I read in Essentialism by Greg McKeown.

I have seen noticeable difference in the amount of progress I have made with my life in the past two weeks since I began to decide. Decide is a verb. Beware! Architecture needs focus. Mostly on the things that matter. To achieve it, you may have to push your norms of acceptable behaviour that you follow in routine.

Every breath of it. Question everything… The time you wake up, the colour of the wall that you see, the time you take to get to the bath to wash your face, the number of apps you use, the number of times you check these apps between opening your eyes, and the visit to the bath for a face wash. Even the number of breaths you take, and so on… Question everything. It will help you look inwards, declutter your life fully, and do remember to do this every beating second of your life, find meaning about what you do/have to do — doing is not the end of things. But it is the reason most of us find the reason to live.

Remember this will make all the difference.
