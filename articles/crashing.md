**Crashing**.

Somethings are worth fighting for, somethings are not, for some people choose the easy way, and in their horrors they drown you away. Some people write it on paper, burn away the rest of their souls, for love is not found in these things people say, in the things they tell you to make you like them, love is found in staying, staying even when the times seem tough, waiting for the hard times to pass, and begin again, not everyone will understand this for they are afraid, afraid that they might be wrong, about happiness or pain. For fear ruled their minds when they wrote about love, you see love is the opposite of fear instead, that’s why I don’t believe in these posts that don’t ring true to my heart, for my heart was not stolen, I gave it to you, to crush, and play all day, until you want to crash into me, and keep crashing again.
