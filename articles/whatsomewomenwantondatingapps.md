**What some women want on dating apps?**

First, was a girl who said she wanted commitment, intimacy, monogamy and a relationship. But her version of intimacy is not cuddles, it's sex only. She kissed me on the pavement after getting drunk the first night. She ended things after having sex a lot times on the first two days of meeting. Also I think she lied about what she wanted. Met outdoors, then went home.

Second, was a girl who stays in Pune (100 miles away) who wanted someone to come have sex with her at a beck and call notice, also not monogamy. Met outdoors.

Third, was a girl who was divorced, lives in Andheri (50 miles away) with a beagle and a cat, is flamboyantly rich, and wants to marry someone and have kids. She called me over for grocery shopping and cooking dinner together. But when I paid the visit, she said she is an insomniac, and takes sleeping pills, and her insomnia triggers epilepsy. Also in the hour we spent together, she was freakishly silent. She went to bed without saying goodnight. I slept on the couch, and left in the morning.
