**Soundboarding**.

So what are you saying is you know what is sound boarding?

Sound boarding is basically process in which a person say for example me e I will talk to you about my problems for probably about things I am doing in my problem I will tell you the story of my life or of my project and in process of telling the story of my project I will be able to figure out all the blocks that are coming to me e that I am currently trying to solve in that project. now sound boarding does not necessarily involve a lot of involvement from your end.except that you will have to probably listen to everything I am saying without interrupting or maybe with a bit of curiosity and with a restaining agent. What I mean to say is that you will pull me back if I am digressing a lot so that is all your supported and if you are an expert of the topic that I am discussing then you will give me your inputs which might not be like a lecture which will be just small tweak in my flow of thought and all those inputs will add clarity to my slow of thought and it is what will generate the answers to most of my problems that I am facing currently.

I deal with questions that people have difficulty in solving by themselves.

I create a step by step path for someone to get from point A to point B.

How do we do it?
1. you talk,
2. give me a complete idea of what you are doing,
3. then you tell me your problems,
4. then we will talk about what you have tried so far,
5. then we play tetris with all variables,
6. then we will know what works best in the current scenario
