**Delusions**.

I saw Joker. He is a delusional character. He imagined his neighbour to be in love with him. And that seemed to be quite a thought for me. So here are a few thoughts.

Are you real?
Are you my delusion?

Maybe, I am delusional about being in love with you. That's how delusions work, don't they? They are beliefs that you dream on under the name of faith, and hope. They are mostly akin to the emotions of being loved, being wanted, and belonging. They happen under the stress of mundane routine.

Am I real?
Am I your delusion?

But, my story has a routine. It has a pattern of meeting people, and then of them leaving me. The only thing common about these experiences was routine. Do you notice how they leave me, and not the other way around of me leaving them? It's their choice.

I have been going back to back having this same experience for 6 years now. So maybe I am only an idea that exists. That is passed from people to people. Maybe I exist in the human form. But I am only another entity.

Maybe I am not the only one. There are so many of us out there who feel the same way. Maybe we are all but a figment of someone's imagination. A figment of imagination created by routine. The routine of doing things that render me so obvious that other people can't help but take me for granted.

Now being taken for granted is not a problem. It's a sign. A sign that, in some cases, maybe your whole life is not actually happening the way you think it is. Maybe it's only imagination. Maybe this is what the Matrix is.

Maybe that's what Einstein meant when he said, "Reality is merely an illusion. Albeit a very persistent one." The answer to break away is to consciously choose something non monotonous to do. To walk away from monotony. Maybe this is not the real meaning of life. But, a key to make you start thinking consciously and deep about every move you make.
