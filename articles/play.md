**Play**.

Play "Will this work for you?"

It's a game where we,
1. Take turns to share our ideas for our relationship.
2. Take turns to check if the ideas are mutual.
3. Leave everything that isn't mutual out of the picture.
4. Choose each other over ideas... because duh!

We are real, ideas are imaginary.
