**The last supper**.

There are moments of surprises that dot our lives from eventful days to dinner dates. There are a few things that make an impression leaving an insight behind some that span a night or last a lifetime. Most of where we go depends on where we want to be. Learning to keep secrets with liars might be the safest bet or may not be. But the easiest wish to fulfill is to ask for a beautiful life for, for life, thatâ€™s a default way to be. Simplicity then is not a habit but what you see in every thing, everything for the future, and every thing that has been. Then everything around you grows in the life just got lucky way. This is how you give life meaning.
