**Scootsy**.

Today, let me share a short insight with you. After an influx of people in my life from architecture. dating apps, event spaces, or super-hosting on Airbnb, I have learnt these things. Things about successful habits, satisfaction in life, and generic human behaviours. Most people that I have met have been good at heart.

Most people are searching of a piece that’s missing from their lives. They are all looking for an escape, albeit they cannot define it. For some of us, this search becomes life itself. That’s when you go person to person, thing to thing, looking for something. That’s when you splurge your money on shopping.

But that’s not the answer. A search for what fits, and what doesn’t will always leave you empty. Life is not a search for meaning. Life is a lesson in acceptance. Accepting whatever comes our way, and see how things work.

At times, it’s starting new things, chasing a few others, or closing other ones. Life is an endless exploration. Aerosmith wrote “Amazing”, a song about it?-?”Life’s a journey, not a destination”. That’s the reason, I chose to work for Scootsy. So far, I have been able to figure that I find my escape in understanding habits.

Although, Bundl bought Scootsy, a month before I joined. Most of my well-wishers worry about the abrupt career change that I have made. I chose to work at a place full of people. People that come from different backgrounds, temperament, and life experiences. And experiences that fulfill the most humane needs that work can bring.

Work that helps deliver emergency supplies, food, and merchandise in under an hour. In my experience, even the United Nations Resource Agency has not beaten this clock. Here’s what I think is positive. Scootsy’s delivery in an hour USP helps me condition my mindset to make quicker decisions, and execute them. This is contrary to what mainstream architecture good practices.

If you have seen throughout life, “The way you anything, is the way you do everything.” For example, If you suck at finishing your food, you will never be a cleaner. Read “Relentless” by Tim Grover to know what a “Cleaner” means. That’s the jackpot. This new mindset does rub off on other areas of my life.

So, your seemingly uninteresting call center has taught me habits worth keeping. A habit of getting things done, and that of being proactive. These make laziness, and procrastination, non-existent in my vocabulary. Outside of Scootsy, they help me get things moving at other enterprises.
