**Social media differences**.

- Facebook, Instagram is an avenue for joking with your customers, and running competitions or giveaway. It’s a place to build a “cult following.”
- Twitter, Medium is prime real estate for getting personal, and talking directly to your customers.
- G+, LinkedIn is a professional landscape, geared toward connecting businesses, and professionals with each other, and opening the door to engaging with individuals outside of your usual social circles.
