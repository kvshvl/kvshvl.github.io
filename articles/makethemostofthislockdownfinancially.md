**Make the most of this lockdown financially**.

So the whole ideas is to make a post on typewrighter using Google Voice input. Although this might sound like a  futile exercise, what I am trying to do is to write for 1 minute and this text becomes an article. Posting one article on typewriter gets me about 10 rupees a day. So if I have to earn about a lakh rupees in one day then I will have to post 10000 articles in total. The fun part is, since every article only takes a minute, I will have to spend 10000 minutes, or 167 hours, or roughly about 7 days, that is one week to reach my goal.

All of this need not have any predefined subject line, topic line, or sense. The entire success of this exercise, also contributes to being an essential tool for soundboarding. So much for global lockdown. I would suggest that you read this article once again, and clearly understand the steps within all of these sentences.
