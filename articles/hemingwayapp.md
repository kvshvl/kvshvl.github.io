**Hemingway app**.

The reason I stopped using hemingway app is not because I think they do a bad job. Well that is certainly not the case. They do an amazing job. My thought is that I write that way I think. I wonder how will I shape my mind, my way, if I learn by the rules set by others or in this case, the makers of a sincerely awesome app.
