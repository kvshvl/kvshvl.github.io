**Want to look away**.

If you have any complaints then it is that in this process I cannot look away. well actually I just called it I close my eyes when speaking out the sentence the previous sentence. I think the glare from my phone will not bother my eyes because I am talking by keeping the phone very close to me but I do wish that it would have been better if I could look away and my voice was loud enough to speak out things. it is sort of difficult to find a quiet place where I can keep recording without being filled as just by people for all the things I think of but it is also very easy to build up a room for myself where I can sit in alone and keep dumping my thoughts. This is a relief. you know I am very sensitive to things like if I watch a movie I will feel of it like if I watch Lucy for example I will feel that I can also do that because it is all about mind work and everything that you think will happen and that is such a fact of nature and it is very very inspiring to know that all your good thoughts will come back to you as good things and this will happen throughout your lifetime. So now that I have realised this about myself I think it is easier for me to be open to criticism and be comfortable in my own skin. Although I get saturated with my thoughts it is still better than having to type out and think of typing. this is like taking out a crucial block out of my life so that I can create more creatives.
