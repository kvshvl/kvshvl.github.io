**Intelligently**.

> “If we share, everyone can have enough.”

We believe that every society has enough to feed itself. Everyone will cherish what they create by sharing. The common man’s contributions through the internet will override all existing means of thinking. GRÜHAM is a “build” event series that builds shelter to meet the needs of a community. We build a WikiHouse because of the community building that comes out through the process.

All our data is freely shared on GitHub. You can fork it, and give back something more to our world. Doing more “build” events will meet the needs of our civilization. The sharing economy will become powerful enough to end most of what pandora’s box had led into our world. Now you can be a part of this movement too.

We may not change the world, yet let's begin here.
