**Countryside**.

I should have been at 5,000 post but I am still at about 170, and I am not blaming anything for it it is just that I am lazy. Interestingly I have been able to improve my speech lot, have a couple of phone fights here and there, and arguments on the phone, but that's it. I often keep thinking that I should go back to the small place where I did my schooling and start accepting residentships for my Airbnb guests. It would be cool, no? To go in the countryside and live with people who come to stay with you to learn something from you and then you learn something from them in exchange. I think that must be really great idea because then you can also enjoy the countryside, have your bills paid, grow your network, and at the same time be great at your craft.
