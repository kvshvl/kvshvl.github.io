**How to keep your creative writing spree alive?**

I spent last night creating a timed protocol to create articles.

1. Set a pomodoro timer to 3 intervals of 5 mins each.  
The first five minutes are for recording a basic draft using LiveTranscribe by Google.  
The second five minutes are for editing the draft into an one page article using Grammarly keyboard.  
The third five minutes are to post the finished article to Typewrighter.

2. Repeat the above session thrice before taking a break.  
My mind tends to saturate after three consecutive train of thoughts. You can choose your normals.

3. Take a 15 min long break to attend to daily tasks around me.

4. Repeat this process until I hit my target number of posts on Typewrighter.
