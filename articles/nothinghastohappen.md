**Nothing has to happen**.

Look at this photograph, how abnormal it is. A mixture of concrete mass, next to the sands, and the seas, or below the mountains maybe. This is what you get, when you place two extremes besides, you can feel the angst, even without a clue about the space. As for all of us in this universe, this thought goes beyond just photographs, and maps, and charts, and life hacks, and hearts. Personal though this might be, to me or to someone else, I have come to believe, against that popular quote,

> “If it is meant to be then it will happen.”

Pause for one sec, and see for thyself: what makes you think, that we are all so special, that the bloody universe will spare, it’s resources, and time, to make things happen for thine? Honestly speaking, the universe doesn’t care, it has its own problems, well you might be the cause, for about half of them. So that kinda help, ain’t coming your way, not now, not ever. So please stop believing, in happenings, and leisure, Will Smith was right when he said,

> “If you want something, go get it.”

Because the only things that might happen, are the ones you put on your Google Keep.
