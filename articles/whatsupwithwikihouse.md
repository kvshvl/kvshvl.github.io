**What’s up with WikiHouse?**

The thought is what’s the end product or service we are offering? There are many firms in the process of building a WikiHouse, and use it for commercial purposes: competition in a commercial market. We can share our knowledge with the wikihouse project; or develop certain designs for commercial purposes; develop the model that can be scaled up or down depending on the user’s particular needs; share all our data on to the commons, and sell it off the commons on an online shop; make a WikiHouse on site for our clients; teach people to build a WikiHouse; sell components/complete design products; sell low energy additions for the WikiHouse; travel for on site assignments.

A goal here is to ease appropriation of design. An ideal way to move forward would be a book that documents all the work we have done on the project so far.
