**Being supportive**.

What do you do if you travel to another city to spend time with your partner because she/he is sad. And she/he pushes you away, then asks you to wait for her/his birthday, and spend her/his birthday evening by going out with some other guy friend/girl friend who asked her/him for dinner at 8pm, and then say it's just drinks, and then come after dinner to do a small dinner post 10pm with you where he/she drops her/him and then your partner tells her/his friends that it was dinner, and you feel terribly sidelined? 

What would you do?
