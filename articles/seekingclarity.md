**Seeking clarity**.

This might sound like whining. It is just a train of thoughts. Sharing it anyways. I couldn’t agree more about the variety.

In India, there are a lot of people/ cultures/ languages/ lifestyles. Here, the vernacular/age-old methods of construction work best. I am curious about how can I deploy the WikiHouse here. People have strong faith in the vernacular styles of architecture. The masses prefer concrete for the invariable speed, and the unskilled labour it requires. // Concrete-based construction pollutes the environment a lot more than we know. I know this information is dicey. While making sketchup models, prototypes, telling the open source concept to my clients. I have found that I somehow lack a sense of clarity.

Clarity as in: Why do we not approach improvisation by working on what exists? equation: vernacular + research on vernacular = improvisation. It seems to me that we are trying out the equation: WikiHouse + vernacular = solution. Seems to be a forced derivative as a process. Now, if we want WikiHouse to be the free, shared way of constructing a house at a global scale. Then we need to find common ground between mediums. Otherwise, my local carpenter has found more efficacy in what we intend to do in the trade. Even when we did those side walls with timber members, I felt betrayed.

Well we definitely had to repurpose those doors, and windows to justify that move. I feel there is a way that lets us build more than part-WikiHouses. WikiHouse as a method where anyone can pick up any commons folder. Go to the local hardware store. Find a cutting tool not limited to CNCs — as CNCs are hard to find. Build themselves a full fledged permanent shelter in under a week’s time. The idea still fascinates me. But there is a glitch. We need standardization.

Of components, techniques, material sets based on — as you might be aware of — climate. Comments — as of now all I see is the text is moving around in circles.

Summary: Clarity of direction. To be deployable by an unskilled labourer or not. Standardization of elements. Design styles based on climates. Shoot! “We often tend to forget what we do. There are so many of us doing the same things in their own little ways.”
