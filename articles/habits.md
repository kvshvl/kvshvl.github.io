**Habits**.

What is the best habit that you can build for yourself?

Here are a series of habits that will contribute greatly to your growth and success. Now the first habit that I would like to build is compounding. by itself compounding is a very popular habit which has been recommended by a lot of people especially in regards to money and investing but this thing about habits the moment you build a habit it often spills over to every aspect of your life.

So, why compounding?

Youyou know there was a time when a friend of mine told me about this girl in his Masters architectural class who would make sketches: simple line drawings that she would make everyday and pin them on a wall. my friend says on the first day she had only one sketch on the wall in the small corner and nobody paid attention to it. but as days meant by she was able to fill the entire wall bit by bit as if she was doing a wall full of art brick by brick.

This is what I learnt from the story.

I I learnt that this kid wood make one more sketch then she had made the previous day. what that means if she made of sketch today she would make two tomorrow and three day after and so on. In that way it did not take a lot of days to fill up that wall. Now most of the creatives here would argue that she could have also achieved the same results by doing one sketch in a day. But that is not the point. 

See see the trouble with doing one thing a day and trying to keep doing only one thing a day is that it needs you to be consistent because if you do not make one you will be on zero. The secret to all success is being non zero. Which means that he was building habit to create art and she was also at the same time creating a hedge against failing by creating more of it by giving more than what was required of her. 

This way if she ever had to stop in between the series of creativity and go at end to something that was far more important in life he would be able to who achieved the minimum for the day and at the same time not stress about losing on time and be able to focus on the other thing at the same time.

This means that compounding is the hedge against failing at consistency.
