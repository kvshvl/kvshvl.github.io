**Erotica 12**.

She: It is a quaint Sunday afternoon, 
A long while since I have sat and reflected. 
My sister sits in the next room,
Laughing on some random video. 
The occasional chirping of birds,
Is more clear these days. 
Oh gosh, how I have missed these voices.

He: or did you miss the sound of water
When you were staring at me in the bath
That splashing on that stone
That hid your thumping heart
From my lecherous moans?

She: Words can deceive, 
I agree. 
But let not emotions hide. 
Leave, let's go. 
And find ourselves wrapped in bedsheets
Late until the afternoon.

He: Where though?
I'm shut away by the powers that be
I can't help but wait for your teases
See if you mean
All those lists you want to do for me

Most of me think otherwise
Thinks of you as a thief of hearts
Dragging men by your flowing hair
Leaving them all in tears
On a mountainside

She: Ah! Won't that be nice? 
To steal hearts and make others cry
Instead of the one being 
Who always ends up crying 
Of us, let's not put so much thought into it.
Cause who knows what we would be by the end of it

He: How dare you to give me hope 
And snatch it all away in a poem
You are getting assaulted
The moment you land here
You will be kidnap-ped 
In the airport lounge
And made love to 
In the nearest cabin 
We find

She: I give you not thee 
The power to kidnap me
And fuck me in a cabin
Instead, show me around 
Take me to a cafe 
And then later 
Let's find a place 
And fuck for like ages

He: You are a seductress
Why? Would I trust you!
What? If you ghost me!
Runaway into an urban jungle?
Without leaving a clue!

She: People leave clues 
For where they can not find
You and I are bound 
And no matter where we are 
We always end up around

He: What's taking you long?
What plans are you hatching?
Is this a trap?
For you cannot disappear for years
Like the last time around
And leave me wanting
To burn all those calories
And all those electric touches
That I spent on all the wrong women
Wishing they had our exact spark

Well, I am going to hold you tight, 
Push you down harder
Slide my boner in
Till you choke
And then be as gentle as I can be
Until you don't want to let me go

She: Days have gone by hard and crude 
We both suffered and howled 
Calling me names 
And not trusting me now
Will only bring more pain
And I am done with that now

He: Like tie you up, blindfold you
Tease you for very long
Running my hands and lips
All over your body
Kissing you as a tease
Only a tease and nothing else
Until you beg me to eat you out

She: I will cry out your name
And the world will know 
That a passion is born

He: I hate this distance 
That lie between us
Between Doon and Bangalore
And now Noida and BOM
I want a wildfire running through your arms
When my fingers touch you,
Feel it all warming up

She: My vagina will flow and flow 
An endless volcano 
That makes you trip 
And me on your top
I will show you how it's done
So you know
I am a queen 
And who should get love!

He: You better move here this month
Because I can't take it anymore
My boner is all set to explode
At the same time as your volcano
And never gonna stop
Till you learn to count till 12
And trash talk to you
Until you feel mentally unwell

She: Distance makes the heart grow fonder
They say
Who knows, when we meet 
We may burn the earth down
Stop stop stop
I can't this anymore 
Come here 
Hold me tight 
And engulf me whole

He: Fuck what the world says
Fuck all other quotes
I want to move to you
Or have you move to me
The moment this quarantine goes
So don't you waste your time
Sitting around at home
Book your flight tickets
And come down to Bombay
We will find a place for you
And work on sharing the rent
Spend none on condoms
Only on stuff for our own creative studio
Or if Delhi is cheaper
Then move out of home
I will join you there
And we can rule the world
I doubt we will ever write
Except for our own personal erotica
And all those moans that will echo
Might as well sell background score for sex 
I so want to get a kennel though
For a million more dogs
So I can see you be happy 
Whenever I am not around
Tease me with pictures
Tease me now
Tease me when you aren't orgasming
To my keyboard, and sounds

She: You want me to tie you down and run my lips all over your skin?
Like you own me? 

He: Without letting me touch you? 
Hold you? 
Or feel you grind gently? 
Go slow! 
Until it's obvious that you want me harder than ever 
No matter where we are

She: And without letting you see me
And then go down on you
Without touching you at all

He: How good are you?
How long can you last?
Haven't you any idea?
Because you move like a pro
Though I know you are no match for my cock

She: I'm pretty sure that's true

He: Well, I am going to hold you tight, 
Push you down harder
Slide my boner in
Till you choke
And then be as gentle as I can be
Until you don't want to let me go

She: I definitely don't want to let you go!
Gentle?

He: Because you won't last the minute
The minute I unleash the monster inside me
You will crumble like breadsticks
Dipped in mayonnaise and cream
