**Of pegboards, and walkways**.

She is the most amazing piece of nature that I have ever seen. From the foothills of Kerala to Milky Way galaxy. The way she lets me be. And fights for a certain togetherness. A doubtful mind on a run from a tornado that was blessed.

There is now sand in my shoes which she put there deliberately. I think I should shoot for the days are getting longer incessantly. Too many adverbs, yes too many adverbs is what we had. She left me in a glance, only to stay dancing with the trance. The beauty of her innocence leaves a mark surely.

There has been none like her before, who dared to level up a friendship, it might seem plain, and simple, but a turmoil has died inside. For honestly my humble mind, cannot find peace outside of her reality.
