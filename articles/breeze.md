**Breeze**.

The most fun things to do, is to get up in the morning, and keep running. I have never found myself to be so lazy in my entire life until this quarantine. So far it has been quite an experience. well if you look at it I have barely been able to monetize most of the things that I have been working on but now many doors are opening up. Everything that I had worked on over the past 10 or 15 years have suddenly been a sought-after skill set that everyone wants to have but they have not put in the effort so they have no option but to hire someone like me.

So all those years of learning and curiosity will now start to pay up. Which is very interesting to me because I never thought that this day would come. Almost everything from architecture to web design to venture capitalism 2 you just going out there and doing thanks has been the key for myself. Life is now breeze because I don't have to do a 9 to 5 job. Instead I can do a lot more monetarily by picking up these projects.

Projects that are basically me trying to help other people solve their problems.
