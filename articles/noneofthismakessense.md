**None of this makes sense**.

I don't know if you have read the Archie's comic strip series, but there is a story in which Jughead tops the French class. Now believe me Jughead is supposed to be not so good at French. But he does it because instead of studying for the test, she goes to work at a French restaurant. Now because he ends up working with French men and women, he learns more about the language than any book or teacher could have taught him. There is a quote I don't remember by whom - I think by Lao Tzu - it says, "if I listen I will forget, if I read I will remember, if I do I will understand".

This is the most apt process to learning for life. That's what Jughead did and as far as I know that's what everyone should do. So whatever your dream is, whatever you plan to do next, start whereever you can and stick to it.
