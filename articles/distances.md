**Distances**.

So I have been traveling back and forth cities now. The one thing that I have realised in process is that our perspective about distances change when we travel. For example, a distance between Bombay and Pune of about 122kms in 2.5 hours used to feel like a lot. But yesterday it felt like a place next door. Maybe that’s what globetrotting does to you.

Our take on life changes in direct proportion to the experiences that you expose yourself to. Travel makes superficial everything that would be deemed important that a person who hasn’t travelled often would deem important. Life seems larger than what worries you everyday. Routine seems to blind us to the vast world that lies beyond it. It is funny how millions of us would choose to scurry into routines that seem dull to those who put themselves in situations that are reckless, dangerous, but alive.
