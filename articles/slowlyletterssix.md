**Slowly letters 6**.

I am doing great.

You are most welcome. I love writing long letters on most days :D 
Hahahaha, intermittent fasting only has the idea of eating you out attached to it :P It must be a bold move for an introvert to come over such a platform. That's so brave of you.

Yes, I do write long letters on most days. Well, it does take a lot of time and attention, but I do it for the joy of it. I have a slight level of OCD, and I am a stickler for great communication, words. I often lose my cool if people misrepresent or stretch facts in a discussion.

I am looking for someone to travel, and experience life with. I have lost the hope for love. I tried dating apps, but after 2000 first dates, and many many flings, I realized that in the end, we are all alone. You did a wise thing by not looking for love outside. I am sure love will find you now, much like the Sorceror's Stone - It comes to those who don't seek it. I am sure peace and serenity follows :P

I guess we both share the same interests - to earn and travel every place on this planet, and yes! Dogs!. They are ❤️. I don't want to have my own kids. Maybe adopt a kid, but then it's expensive to raise a child. I always wonder how does this become more expensive for every new generation.

I am an architect. Creativity or not, I often try to solve problems for other people. There is a lot of satisfaction in lifting the weight off someone's shoulders. You should try it sometime. I have my good and bad days, so I am not sure if this nature always attracts positivity, but it sure does attract depressed souls in search of positivity.

Well if you want to plan to move then we can might as well exchange phone numbers, share notes, and help each other. I love trekking. I actually like the Instagram photos under #britishcolumbia or BC as they call it.

I hope it begins without the risks that I run with losing things. Thanks for the wishes. My mom works in a bank. So that's her only home. She lives in a rented apartment in the city. So clearly, I'm not rich, yet :D

Well strangers or not, how does it matter! I get to journal here, organize my thoughts, and also get others to tell me what they think. Who knows what might click somewhere, and everything will start to make sense, no?

What do you mean? What did I inspire you to do? 

I learnt those languages on online chatrooms, and as an Airbnb host. Talking to people who can speak in English, and learning their language over time. This takes a lot of time and effort too. Like these letters.

I have never been a fan of spiritual books. But I guess yours must be a Bong thing, since most of my Bong friends read them a lot. I read non-fiction, self help, autobiographies, and something classics or fiction. I am not a huge fan of fantasies. I write eroticas though.

Why do you have anger issues? Can you tell me more about it? I love writing letters more though. It's therapeutic.

My birthdate is 31/12/1990. You are writing a CV yes :P I can't help but believe you. What exactly is the project about?

Well, you should explore Bombay. My plans are going to be an expensive affair. I want to do all those things I spoke about workwise before moving out. That's great!

My brother is a photographer. What is on your reading list? Do you have any recommendations? I can't wait to know more about sustainability. I am curious about human behaviour. I will probably read about it in the coming year. Which plants do you have? 

From today I started uploading my pictures, and art on my vsco.co account.
Shy is not a great thing to be :D You don't know what you are missing out on in life experiences.

Yours truly,
