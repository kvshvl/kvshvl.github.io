**Smoking easy**.

Trying to get something out of it speak in a particular level of volume to get this thing done right and it will not pick up the words are saying this is a very good way of practicing your thought flow your speech the tonality that is used in the space of your words that come out of your mouth piece not space not piece, pace. see can talk to the phone and you can also direct instructions to it so it is a very good way of recording your voice and make it into a text article for all I know you can also be smoking a joint or something while you are doing this it's very creative way of doing things, just saying you could do it. show the process is a very small process it takes less than a minute I initially thought it would take me a lot more time but that is not the case. This is kind of a marathon but this marathon will be off for generations to come.
