**Instagram strategy**.

I have always looked at Instagram as a note taking app more than a photo sharing app. Most people do not use all the features of any platform, in the same way as they do not use all the features of their smartphones. The thing - although I don't agree with the idea - seems similar to that of leveraging excess capacity like Uber, Airbnb, blah blah. Now you know I am lazy so I prepared this strategy for Instagram to be my chosen platform for content creation instead of content publishing because who will use 5 RCs for the same TV, right?

Here's what I think.

**Level 1 - Creating book content**.

Instagram's caption space has 2000 chars in one post = that's almost 1.25 page.

I intend to use these page/s to make book/s.

If you fill in complete captions for about 200 posts = then you would have written an equal of 300 pages = that's 1 book.

You will find the process taxing because it is strenuous to write about the same topic 200 times in a row. Hence to make this lazier, I recommend using hashtags for example #akshaycoffee, #akshaythis, #akshaythat, #akshayxyz.

The advantages here are:
- This way people can track your content about specific topics.
- You can write about different topics 200 times in a row.
- You can tap on any of your hashtags and keep track of your progress.
- You can see the Top/Recent posts in any hashtag.

I view this as a tool to get your peers and society-at-large to review your content. You can use a desktop browser to copy all the captions under any hashtag to Google documents. This document can be exported to become an eBook in .epub/.pdf/.any-other-file-format-you-fancy.

**Level 2 - Creating lectures content**.

I intend to use these book/s as content to give one-hour-long-lecture/s on any topic with/without fumbling. I can use 1 book as enough content to give a 1 one-hour-long-lecture on any topic with fumbling. I can use 2 books as enough content to give a 1 one-hour-long-lecture on any topic without fumbling. I can use 4 books as enough content to give a 2 one-hour-long-lecture on any topic without fumbling, and so on.

Some friends believe they can use 1 book as enough content to give 4 one-hour-long-lectures without fumbling. This is subjective. You do you. Oh! You can also upload this to YouTube.

**Level 3 - Creating Vit. M**.

If you fill in complete captions for about 200 posts = then you would have written an equal of 300 pages = that's 1 book = enough content for 1 one-hour-long-lecture with fumbling.

You can go to any cafe/venue and ask for a spot to do a paid one-hour-long guest lecture using this book as leverage. A venue will ask you for a profit share OR ask you to pay a lumpsum amount as rent. A venue lecture for 50 participants at INR 250/participant may raise about INR 12,500 for an hour of work.

If you fill in complete captions for about 400 posts = then you would have written an equal of 600 pages = that's 2 books = enough content for 1 one-hour-long-lecture without fumbling.

You can go to any college/university and ask for a spot to do a paid one-hour-long guest lecture using these books as leverage. A university will not ask you for a profit share. A university lecture for 300 participants at INR 100/participant may raise about INR 30,000 for an hour of work.

**Level 4 - Creating workshop content**.

If you fill in complete captions for about 800 posts = then you would have written an equal of 1200 pages = that's 4 books = enough content for 2 one-hour-long-lectures without fumbling.

You can go to any cafe/venue and ask for a spot to do a paid six-hour-long workshop using these books as leverage. A venue will ask you for a profit share OR ask you to pay a lumpsum amount as rent.

The workshop format in reverse order:

> [ 05 PM - Last Lecture - 04 PM - Exercise review - 03 PM - Exercise in progress - 02 PM - Lunch - 01 PM - Exercise briefing - 12 PM - First Lecture - 11 AM ]

- 11 AM - 12 PM - First Lecture
- 12 PM - 01 PM - Exercise briefing
- 01 PM - 02 PM - Lunch
- 02 PM - 03 PM - Exercise in progress
- 03 PM - 04 PM - Exercise review
- 04 PM - 05 PM - Last Lecture

The workshop format in regular order:

> [ 11 AM - First Lecture - 12 PM - Exercise briefing - 01 PM- Lunch - 02 PM - Exercise in progress - 03 PM - Exercise review - 04 PM - Last Lecture - 05 PM ]

This format means you will be talking at the group from 11am-12pm and 4pm-5pm. This format means you will be talking to the group from 12pm-1pm and 3pm-4pm. This format means you will be doing nothing from 1pm-2pm and 2pm-3pm. A workshop for 10 participants at INR 10000/participant may raise about INR 100,000 for 4 hours of work. You can charge more depending upon the exercise/s that you can create for your particular topic/s.

Bear in mind that:
- Every exercise should give the participant/s an item to take home OR something to show his/her/their friends and family.
- This item/something should be a tangible product i.e., it should not be a certificate.
- You can do individual exercises, team exercises, whole-class exercises.
- You can split this hour into as many permutation and combination/s of these exercises.
- You get 6 mins/participant to review their work on a one-on-one basis, so ideally create one amazing exercise only.
- You get 60 mins to complete all exercises, use it wisely.

**Fin**.

I mean these books, lectures, and workshops are what Instagram captions can lead to, understood?
