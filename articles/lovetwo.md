**Love 2**.

Love is like photo editing. Where you reach a point that you know there is more to be done by your standards, but the picture looks so good already that your standards fail to add to it eventually. Where the details cannot be better, where the thought of your first idea to be the best idea falters. When you have practiced so much that you reach a point where know bliss. Where the only thing that you can take away is; commitment, hard work, and an enduring belief in the present, and a future.

I would have never thought that an unremarkable image would mean a start of something so huge for me. The whole idea behind getting on Instagram was to document my work in progress, or to a certain extent documenting the work that I had done over the previous years. It may be a lot that can be ignored, but every day has so far come to me with a learning experience. The things that are possible in this world that we occupy, and the things that I have used now, and then to create a bright future with all those people who have touched my life. The entire intention now is to dump my personal experiences, and in simpler words, to maintain a journal here.

Not a daily one, but a journal that intends to add words to images, all in one place. So that when they come together piece by piece, I can publish my own book, or maybe fuck that! Creating for the sake of creating. Documenting for the sake of documenting. Leaving it all for civilization to decipher in the ways that time seems fit. The purpose of social media is not to hit a self set number as a goal.

But to continue creating, and sharing a part of you. It is not to assign meaning to your life based on what you see in the life of others. But to see where you stand, and appreciate whatever it is that you hold. Self love.
