**I won't let you walk away, with a broken heart**.

I won’t let you walk away, with a broken heart,
And I wanna ride away from the past,
I wanna kiss your tears good bye coz’ I love you.

If you need to know what I will do,
Try asking once, and it comes true,
You don’t need to cry my baby, I love you.

On a rainy, rainy, rainy, rainy, rainy,
On a rainy day you wished,
To kiss me on my lips,
And I know what you mean by it too.

We will be together for evers,
For a daughter like Chanelle, and you know,
I hope you remember them, don’t you?

Wanna roam these beaches of Goa,
With the big sun shining down on us,
I can’t take my eyes off this beautiful you.

And I’m sorry for the things I did,
Hurt ur heart, my devil;
With our love so true, I know its glue.

And I wish to pour it on you,
And stick to you,
Just the way we did every afternoons.

I am gonna be yours forever,
Even if you take me dear,
I love you, you love me, & we love us two.
