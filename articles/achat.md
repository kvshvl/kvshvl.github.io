**A chat**.

It is just hard for me to find someone who has the same troubles as I do. And then ignore them for the longest while till they fade away into the shadows. I wonder if they can still see me, but I wish they returned. I don’t know how to tell you, show you what I mean, because every time I want to find love, love escapes me. I wish you are well, and achieve all of your dreams, I wanted to write you letters, to all the places that you will be. Do you even like me a bit, is a question that haunts me, leaving me puzzled every night, with calls being cut by thee. It is hard to believe anything at all, with those midnight kisses that you sneak, I wish you were for real coz my heart aches, at the thought of losing something like you and me. I have no clue how we will meet, if we don’t talk till then, there must be a way that you know of, but I ain’t half as smart as thee.

OK are you trying to sweep me off my feet, Because I ll have you know mister That I’ll be a bit heavy for thee.

I don’t mind the weight of thee, when your thought scare me, to be distant, and far away from love in every living bliss. I admire you have a tact for poetry, but sometimes that is what kills, love, and lust, and breds anger forever, in something as subtle as we. Can I have your address? Something where you will always be, even if we don’t meet, and blah blah, that’s where I can write to see, seduce you through my words atleast, if not by my KGS.

There is no tact in poetry It’s just lazy As is everything, Including you, and me, As there is no subtle we. Let me tell you a story, My paths crossed with a guy, Let’s call him dick, He was cute, and all But I am not sure we’d click But now as I write this, I think maybe it’s something, I guess i’ll have it in place of nothing. Write to me …

That’s real address forever.

That seems made up in the eon tonight, just to keep me separate for thee, must be for good, because you wouldn’t have made the effort, of writing a poem back to me.

This is me, from eternity, in the search of an reply from thee, maybe we could write poems, and publish a love story. I agree many have been written in the memory of glee, but let’s make ours stand out of time, with our secret little relationship. Now don’t you go out there, and label, brand our relationship with sex, I am just using the word in a broader sense, and there shall be other things to feel.

I have written a few line of love, disguised by lust in this midnight journey, I hope the reach you, and find you well, or maybe I should just change my metric.

I want to write, a poem a day, it might be shit, but that’s okay.

Let’s write our texts as poems, and publish them on medium, maybe it will work as the bond, to keep us together, and from falling apart. What say of this whispering, that my mind has begun to speak, shall we find each other, and love through the means of poetry.
