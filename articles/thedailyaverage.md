**The daily average**.

The daily average is at Rs. 25 now. I want to push it further up. Also now, since the team at Typewrighter has improved the interface, making it easy to type, and use all the functions given here - these articles are my personal journal entries. 

So all the best if you are going to be a part of my messy life. I don't care about who knows these details, because well the surveillance agencies knows it all anyway, so duh! 

I have spent quiet a many years on dating sites, and I have always been cheated upon. With people asking for a break to figure things out, and then going on to find someone else, while telling me that there are no overlaps in all of that time. Some things hurt you know. Especially when they happen more than twice. I don't know if there is a flaw in me, I can't tell if I gravitate towards such negative experiences, or if these experiences gravitate to me. Anyway, no matter what the truth might be, it is important to remind ourselves that being supportive is the best way to solve all of our life problems. 

Letting go is an art that I might have mastered so far, but the art of not being in the spot, where you don't have to let go, where people choose to stay by your side, is something that I am still getting lucky at.

Love.
