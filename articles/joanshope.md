**Joan’s hope**.

We see, and wonder,
Why does a moon shine;
Under cloudy skies in furious rain,
With celestial light crashing earthwards

With doors banging away,
As the breeze turns into a gale;
You stole my heart in a glance,
And with a hangout place

You make me feel lost, and found today,
Last night we had some;
Rookie mistakes to wisdom for a change,
Like there is more in adding to a piece

Than standing out solo instead,
But of these things that I have realised yesterday;
These three are the best,
You just know when you know it’s forever

Here the past doesn’t matter,
In the end we are all just humans;
looking for an escape, a warm body,
or to shine as the moon under the cloudy skies.
