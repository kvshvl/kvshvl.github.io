**The locus of all focus**.

There isn’t much that we don’t know about life. There has been a lot that is written on it. Very little read. The idea is to read a book a day, try a new meal a day, do the only thing you love for a living, scrap all other plans, and write. Simplicity then, is not the key, it’s the only way to do things right.
